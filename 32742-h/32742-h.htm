<h1>THE AUTO BOYS' MYSTERY</h1>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>PROLOGUE</span></h2>

<p>The Auto Boys had been camped on the unfrequented
shore of Opal Lake for several days.
At first hunting and fishing were the only enlivening
features of this, their unusual summer
outing.</p>

<p>Opal Lake, far up in the big northern woods,
had at this time no other campers. True,
there was an abandoned clubhouse on a nearby
point not far from where Phil Way, Billy
Worth, Dave MacLester and Paul Jones selected
the spot for their Outing Camp. But, until
within a day or two, even the clubhouse had
seemed to be as it looked, deserted.</p>

<p>But a smoke being seen one day, the boys had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
become curious. Without actually entering the
house itself, they had made individual or collective
trips that way. Also strange sounds
had been heard, and even human presence had
been detected. Finally Paul, the youngest of
the boys, made a cautious trip thither and even
entered the house where he had heard voices,
and otherwise had detected that real folks were
undoubtedly there; though why they were there
Paul could only guess. Perhaps they were in
search of a bag of money, said to be twenty
thousand dollars, stolen three years before and
supposed still to be hidden somewhere in that
region.</p>

<p>Strange men had been seen near the end of a
gravel road which the Longknives Club (owners
of the now abandoned clubhouse) were then constructing
for their own use and convenience.
The unexpected loss of this money caused the
work to stop, while the workmen, including a
Swedish foreman, Nels Anderson by name, remained
unpaid to this day.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>Aside from the clubhouse, the nearest inhabitants
to the boys' camp were this same Anderson
and his family, who lived in a small clearing
five or six miles away on the trail leading to
Staretta, a small town perhaps a dozen miles
further on. This was the nearest town to Opal
Lake which was, indeed, a veritable "Lake of
the Woods."</p>

<p>When Paul Jones, finally escaping through
the cellar window, left the clubhouse without
being discovered, he ran across in the dark another
somebody who vanished, uttering strange
and savage oaths. Paul also made himself
scarce in another direction and happened upon
Chip Slider, whose merry response to Paul's
greeting caused both soon to become so friendly
that Paul took Chip to their camp, where a
warm meal soon loosened the boys' tongues and
there was a general interchange of opinions
about game, fish, the big woods, and at last the
abandoned house on the point.</p>

<p>Here the boys learned from Chip that a man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
named Murky was also in the woods and supposedly
after that lost or stolen satchel, thought
by many to be hidden somewhere near. They
learned from Chip more of the robbery of
Grandall, the treasurer of the Longknives, by
this same Murky; also that Murky himself,
through the connivance of Grandall, was held
up by Chip's father by the order of Grandall.
The scheme seemed to have been for Grandall
to get the money thus entrusted to his care in
a way that would divert suspicion against himself
and direct it elsewhere. After sufficient
time had elapsed, then Grandall would manage
to use that money, meanwhile placating Chip's
father, supposedly by bribes.</p>

<p>So open, frank and friendless was young Chip
that he won the Auto Boys' confidence, and
stayed on at the camp, proving himself a valuable
aid and an added link in their narrow social
life.</p>

<p>Shortly before this Chip, encountering Murky
in the woods, had been badly beaten by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
other, and had been seen with a bandaged head
by some of the boys. This induced much pity
for the homeless lad, while Chip's knowledge
of Murky and matters connected with the robbery
just alluded to, made him serviceable in the
matter of knowing more about what was going
on in and about the house on the point. It appeared,
too, that others of the boys during previous
scoutings about the point had seen Murky,
though they did not know who or what he was
until Slider enlightened them.</p>

<p>The general conclusion was that the voices
heard inside the house were more than apt to
have indicated the presence of Murky and Grandall,
still on trail of stolen money that must
have, in some way, slipped into unknown hands.
Still nothing was sure or settled in their minds
except that Chip was a good fellow and Murky
a bad one from almost any point of view one
might take.</p>

<p>Another point occurred to Phil Way, the oldest
and the leader of the Auto Boys; not one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
suspicion against Chip, but for general enlightenment.</p>

<p>A recent visit to their camp when all the boys
were away had occurred. Things had been taken,
including provisions, bedding and dishes.
Perhaps young Slider, more familiar with the
woods life nearby, might have some knowledge
that would lead to the perpetrator.</p>

<p>Taken all round, the camp thought itself
rather in luck that Paul had met this strange
homeless lad in the way and under the circumstances
he did.</p>

<p>Nels Anderson, the giant Swede, had also been
seen under suspicious circumstances by some
of the boys. Taken altogether, the whole matter
was attractive enough to foster certain
ambitions inside the lads, who were too apt to
fancy themselves amateur detectives, a vocation
they knew little or nothing about, rather
than young woodsmen, hunters, or anglers, pursuits
they really did have some knowledge of
and also some skill.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>A QUIET, TRANQUIL SUNDAY</span></h2>

<p>A great bull-frog whose hoarse croaking
could always be heard above other sounds about
the lake, "beginning at exactly eleven o'clock
each night"&#8211;at least so Paul Jones positively
stated&#8211;had started his unmelodious serenade
a long time before the Auto Boys and their
visitor prepared for bed. Paul's adventure,
Chip Slider's whole story and the combined information
thus afforded had proved a most
fruitful field for speculation and conversation.</p>

<p>A bed for Slider was contrived by spreading
over some hemlock boughs a tarpaulin used
on the car for covering baggage. A bucket-seat
cushion from the car served quite nicely
as a pillow. Indeed Chip had not for a long
while had so comfortable a resting place, crude
as it was.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>The plans for the night's sleeping arrangements
were seized upon by Phil as an opportunity
of finding out whether the strange boy
had any knowledge of the recent robbery of the
camp. With this in view his remarks about a
scarcity of blankets and his inquiries as to
where Chip had been managing to find accommodations
were adroitly framed. Quite perfectly
he succeeded in gaining the knowledge
desired, nor did Slider ever suspect that the
Auto Boys' suspicions might very easily have
been directed toward him.</p>

<p>It was truly pitiable to hear Chip tell how
in the night he had stood off a distance in the
woods, taking note of the bright campfire of
the four friends; how he had smelled their
frying bacon when all he had to eat was a little
dry bread; how he had been tempted to apply
at the camp for food and shelter, but was afraid;
how he had spent one whole evening within
sight of the cheerful light about the shack, because
it was a kind of company for him, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
he slipped away and made his bed in the
dead leaves beside a log when at last the campfire
had quite died down.</p>

<p>Yet very interesting, too, was all that Chip
told. One certain fact made clear was that he
had nothing to do with the theft of provisions
and other items from the camp. When this was
fairly plain Phil Way ventured the remark that
Murky had possibly fared better in the woods
than Slider had done.</p>

<p>"No denyin' it," Chip assented. "I found
his hang-out only yesterday. It would put you
in mind of a bear's den, most, to see it."</p>

<p>"Tell all about it," urged Phil. "I'd like to
smoke him out, like we would a woodchuck,"
he added with bitter earnestness.</p>

<p>"Nothin' much to it," answered Slider, but
he went on promptly to report what he had seen
and the manner of his discovery. He had been
in search of berries, or whatever he could find
for food, he said, for his slender store of provisions
was nearly gone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>As he approached a marshy place where he
thought he might find huckleberries, or blueberries,
he discovered Murky there ahead of
him. He had known the evil fellow was in the
woods. He had watched him frequently, believing
he might learn something of the stolen
payroll money or at least what was going on
so secretly about the old clubhouse.</p>

<p>Carefully keeping himself out of sight, Chip
had followed when Murky left the marsh. The
latter walked directly to a thicket on a knoll,
went in among the bushes and disappeared.
Then for a long time Slider patiently waited.
He wondered if the treasure he was seeking
might not be hidden in the copse.</p>

<p>Toward evening Murky left the thicket and
slipped away in the direction of the point of
land occupied by the clubhouse. Improving
this opportunity Slider cautiously visited the
brush-covered knoll. There he found the
tramp's den&#8211;a nest of leaves and pine needles
and branches between two logs. Poles laid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
across the logs and covered over with branches
made a roof for the den. Merely as a place to
sleep the nest looked snug enough, Chip said.</p>

<p>"Didn't see any blankets or dishes, did you?"
Dave asked.</p>

<p>Indeed he had seen these very things, Slider
answered, and had wondered how Murky came
by them. He thought they probably had been
taken from the clubhouse.</p>

<p>A complete quartette of voices answered this
remark, setting Chip right as to the real ownership
of the items mentioned. For not one of
the four friends doubted now that it was Murky
and no one else who had stolen their equipment
and provisions. Considering the unscrupulous
character of the fellow, they only wondered that
he had not plundered the camp completely, leaving
them nothing of value. It did not occur to
them that probably the thief really wished to
take more than he did, but could not conveniently
carry a greater load.</p>

<p>It was a matter of congratulation among the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
boys that they had not, by leaving the camp
again unguarded, given Murky a chance to
return. They were more certain than ever
now that some one of them must be always
in attendance about the shack, and it would have
needed very little to persuade them, also, that
despite Opal Lake's many attractive features
their best course would be to pull up stakes
and bid its shores good-bye.</p>

<p>Even after all were in bed this feature of
their situation was discussed to some extent.
Two main reasons for wishing to occupy the
present camp, for yet a few days, were suggested.
One was that in another week they
must head the Thirty homeward and it was
therefore hardly worth while to search out a
more secure and less frequented locality for a
camp site.</p>

<p>For reason number two there was the lively
interest in the outcome of the search for the
Grandall payroll money, and an earnest wish
to help Chip Slider find the treasure, if possible,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
and return it to the rightful owners,&#8211;the members
of the club which had been practically
broken up by its twenty thousand dollar loss,
as many a larger organization might be.</p>

<p>Quite as usual Paul's voice was the last one
heard when the discussion closed and the quiet
of midnight settled over the forest. All had
been silent for some time. Slider had expressed
in his grateful, however awkward, way
his appreciation of the offer his new friends
made to help him. And Phil Way, answering
for all the boys, said there was no obligation at
all and no thanks necessary,&#8211;that nothing had
been done, as yet, at least.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, it seems to me," said Paul, after
a long silence, "It seems to me as if we were
all going to have our hands full. There will
be Murky and Grandall and Nels Anderson digging
into this mystery just as hard as we can,
and maybe harder. And they are all bad ones,
all of 'em, unless maybe Anderson might not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
be so really bad excepting for being hooked up
with a bad outfit, and all that."</p>

<p>No comment being made by the others with
regard to these remarks, Jones went on to say
that if there was any advantage to be had
by having right and justice on their side,
fortune ought to favor Slider and his
friends in the search to be carried forward.
He reasoned it all out, too, to his own
satisfaction, that in the end justice must prevail
in all things or the whole world would
ultimately go to smash. "And that's a fact,
now, ain't it?" he asked.</p>

<p>There came no answer.</p>

<p>"Well, is it, or don't it, wasn't it!" inquired
Paul, rather facetiously.</p>

<p>Still no answer. Jones raised himself up
on his elbow. He listened. It was perfectly
evident from the heavy breathing all about him
that every one of the other lads was sound
asleep and had been for some time.</p>

<p>"Why! The bing-dinged mummies!" he exclaimed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
"and me talking till I'm all but tongue-tied&#8211;and
to no one!" he added indignantly.</p>

<p>Having heard how Slider slept in the
open woods with not even a cover over
him more than leaves, the Auto Boys
would have been ashamed now to feel afraid in
their snug shack, no matter what strange noises
might come from the lake's dark shore lines.
And though the sounds of various wild creatures
coming to bathe or drink did reach the lads,
as occasionally one or more of them awakened
during the night, no heed was given the disturbers.
It was enough to know that the exceeding
drouth brought animals from long
distances to the water's edge and that they
were much more intent on drinking than having
trouble with anyone or even among
themselves.</p>

<p>Not because it was Sunday morning but due
quite entirely to their having retired so late,
the Auto Boys slept longer than was their custom.
Poor Chip Slider awakened with the first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
peep of daylight, really tremendously surprised
to find himself in such comfortable quarters.
With a sigh of exquisite content and satisfaction
he at once dropped off to sleep again. With
the exception of the night at the bachelor's
shanty he had not known such sweet and unbroken
rest for&#8211;it seemed to him almost his
whole lifetime.</p>

<p>And then again, if Chip had wondered
whether there might be kindness, cheerfulness
and plenty to eat somewhere in the world, as
he most certainly often had done, he must surely
have found the answer now. For when he awoke
again the rich aroma of boiling coffee and cheering
scent of frying bacon greeted him. From
the beach down by the lake, too, there came
lively laughter and a great splashing of water.</p>

<p>"Skip down and dive in! Paddle around
some, then rub down lively!" urged Billy
Worth, who, having had his plunge, was now
nimbly getting breakfast. "Makes a man feel
dandy!" he urged, really thinking that a bath
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
would do Chip good, anyway. "And hold on!"
he added. "Here's soap and a towel if you
care for 'em."</p>

<p>Slider was by no means afraid of the water.
He was glad of the chance to take a swim and
had the sound sense to realize, as well, that he
stood much in need of a vigorous scrubbing.
He hurried down to the water zestfully, albeit
rather lamely for his body was stiff and sore.
Paul made him feel at home at once by turning
a back flip-flop off the now completed raft
for his especial benefit. He asked Chip to follow
suit, but the latter only smiled and dove
off forward, instead.</p>

<p>"Being around the woods as much as you
have been, you'll hardly have a change of clothes
with you, but here's a shirt I'll never need, and
you can keep it if you'll accept it from me,"
said Phil Way in a pleasant, off-hand manner,
when he and Chip were dressing. It was a
friendly yet delicate way of getting the young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
stranger into one garment, at least, that was
clean and whole.</p>

<p>The boy could not refuse nor did he wish to
do so. Though he was sensitive, his feelings
were not injured. Nor were his pride and manliness
hurt at all. It was just because he was
not permitted to feel that he was in any degree
an object of charity.</p>

<p>True, Chip had begged for food along the
road. One would think that did not indicate
much pride on his part; but it should be remembered
that asking for aid among strangers
is very different from receiving anything as
charity from those one considers his friends.</p>

<p>With such a beginning the Auto Boys and
their new acquaintance found Sunday passing
very pleasantly. They wrote letters, took long
walks about the lake and Phil and Paul took
Chip for a ride in the car, going almost to
Anderson's cabin before turning back.</p>

<p>This put the boys in mind of the tree that had
been shivered by the mighty blow of the great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
Swede. After dinner all but Dave walked out to
the end of the gravel road improvement to inspect
the spot again and particularly to see
the slivered stump on which Anderson's sledge
had fallen with such mighty force.</p>

<p>Here, it developed, Slider had made his
headquarters, so far as he may be said to
have had anything of the kind in the
woods. He had kept his stock of food
here, hidden in a weather-beaten cracker box,
that some teamster had used in feeding his
horses. But there was no food left now, Chip
explained. Then he added that but for falling
in with his new friends he would have been
obliged to abandon, for the time, at least, his
search for the stolen fortune. The few berries
he could find would not have been enough to
sustain him. He had eaten even the stray
stalks of stunted corn that grew up where
horses, used in the road building, had been fed.</p>

<p>MacLester had remained on guard in camp
while the others were out upon the old roadway.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
The latter returned to find him perched on the
log projecting over the water, scrutinizing the
Point and the old house there closely.</p>

<p>"Hang it!" declared David forcefully, "I
wish we hadn't agreed that we wouldn't go near
the clubhouse today. I've seen a man moving
about over there. He came out on the porch
toward the lake, once, and after looking all
around he stepped down to that rotten old
wharf and threw something into the water."</p>

<p>"Gee whiz!" Paul Jones burst forth, "was it
the same man we saw before?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the one with the golf cap," MacLester
said. "When he went inside he went upstairs
and closed that window that has been open. He
acted as if he was getting ready to go away."</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SEARCH IN THE OLD HOUSE</span></h2>

<p>Paul's adventure in the old house somehow
seemed to give importance to his opinions on
all matters pertaining to that subject. So when
he suggested that the act of throwing something
into the water by the tenant of the abandoned
building was for the purpose of destroying evidence,
all the boys agreed that quite likely such
was the truth.</p>

<p>What evidence this person, be he Grandall or
not, wished to destroy and why, was the subject
of vast discussion. Since the coming of Slider
among them, particularly, the Auto Boys found
the mystery of the stolen twenty thousand dollars
to possess for them a strong personal interest.
They talked over and over again, and with
the greatest relish, everything that had come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
within their notice in and around the bleak old
structure down there on the Point.</p>

<p>Finally&#8211;it was during the Sunday evening
supper of cold hard-boiled eggs, bread and
butter, bananas, graham crackers and coffee&#8211;that
finally, and at last, Phil Way proposed that
a really serious visit be made to the clubhouse
the following morning. Of any person encountered&#8211;Mr.
Murky excepted, of course&#8211;permission
to use the vise and other equipment
in the automobile shed would be asked. This
would be a reasonable pretext for going to the
clubhouse grounds. And being on those premises,
everyone should look carefully about for
some clue to the stolen money's hiding place.</p>

<p>It was not easy for Captain Phil to suggest
this plan. He was not sure it was quite square
and honorable&#8211;"on the level"&#8211;as some would
say,&#8211;but he called it a stratagem in a worthy
cause and so felt better over it. But really,
since the cause was that of helping Chip Slider,
as against such villains as Murky and Grandall,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
no one could blame Phil, or blame any of the
lads that they welcomed his proposal heartily.</p>

<p>The day had been hot and close. Contrary to
the usual condition, also, the air grew little if
any cooler as night came on. A dive from the
projecting log into the lake to cool off was in
order then, as the boys prepared for bed.</p>

<p>"Just goes to show what a nuisance clothes
are, anyway," observed Paul Jones, as he dried
himself. He was rejoicing exceedingly that he
had only to jump into his nightshirt to be
clothed to all necessary extent, following his
swim. "Heap fine idea if we had clothes for
day time as simple as for night time!" he added.</p>

<p>"Yes sir, it's just such fellows as you, Jones,
that would sooner or later drift right back to the
stone age if there weren't more energetic ones
to drag you along forward, making you wear
clothes and things&#8211;keeping you civilized," was
MacLester's answer. A good-natured grin accompanied
his remarks.</p>

<p>"Well, I s'pose it takes clothes to give some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
folks an appearance of being civilized," was
Paul's warm rejoinder, yet with utmost good-nature.
"But for my part&#8211;well, I'll go on
wearing 'em, David, for your sake."</p>

<p>"And it would make your appearance more
civilized still if you made more civil use of your
tongue," MacLester retorted.</p>

<p>Then Jones had recourse to his usual, "Tush,
tush, Davy! You've tired yourself all out.
You'll feel better tomorrow."</p>

<p>This sort of language, in a fatherly tone that
from Paul's slender size, in contrast with
Dave's large frame, was really grotesque, always
provoked a mild laugh. Usually, too, it
closed the wordy clashes in which the two boys
frequently engaged.</p>

<p>MacLester made no further response. He
was ready for bed now, Billy had already crept
in and Phil and Chip Slider were following
him.</p>

<p>"Last is best of all the game," chirped Jones
in his own blithe, self-complacent way as he saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
that he was bringing up the rear, as often he
had done before. But in another moment he
likewise was in bed. The boys were feeling now
the late hours of the night before. Undoubtedly
they all would "feel better tomorrow."</p>

<p>The probability that the amiable Mr. Murky
would discover Chip Slider's presence in the
woods had been discussed before, but the talk
was renewed at breakfast Monday morning.
Chip was quite sure the old fellow did not suspect
that he was near. He had been very careful
to keep out of Murky's sight and was more
anxious than ever to do so now, being quite
sure there would be serious trouble for himself
and his new friends as well, were he discovered.</p>

<p>It was so apparent that Slider stood in great
dread of the tramp that Phil had no hesitancy
in suggesting that he might better remain at the
camp while the others visited the old house.
Chip agreed readily. He said he could be of no
use elsewhere, and his presence with the Auto
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
Boys would but inflame Murky as much against
them as himself if they chanced to meet him.</p>

<p>With the exception of the upstairs window
being closed, the clubhouse and its surroundings
looked exactly the same as on their former visits
to the Point, the Auto Boys found. The air of
loneliness, melancholy and excessive quiet impressed
them all just as it had done before.
The sound of their own footsteps appeared to
ring in a hollow and unnatural way. Their
voices, though low and subdued, seemed loud
and harsh in their ears in the foreboding calm
of this haunted atmosphere.</p>

<p>"I don't see <i>why</i> it should always feel so
here&#8211;as if a fellow was just going to be scared
to death," remarked Billy in an undertone.</p>

<p>"If you figure it out, though, it's all in your
mind," replied Phil thoughtfully. "Trouble is,
to make yourself believe it."</p>

<p>But notwithstanding his reasoning, sound
enough, undoubtedly, despite the awful tragedy
the Point was so soon to witness&#8211;Captain Phil
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
carried his philosophy rather gingerly, as it
were, when he stepped up on the porch to knock.
In other words, he stepped very lightly. Still
his rapping was right sharp and it should have
brought a response had there been anyone within
hearing, willing to make answer.</p>

<p>Peering in at the windows, the boys could see
nothing in any way different than when they
had been at the house the first time.</p>

<p>"I tell you whoever <i>was</i> here has gone," said
MacLester for the fourth or fifth time, and he
tried the door. It was locked. The door at the
rear,&#8211;that is, the one opening upon the high
porch facing the lake, was likewise tightly secured.</p>

<p>"Now then," said Phil, resolutely, "we're
face to face with the question that has been in
my mind all night. What are we going to do
next? And I'll tell you what we <i>are</i> going to
do. We have no right to go into the house&#8211;no
right at all, one way you look at it. But that
isn't the answer. We are helping Chip Slider
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
with his search for money that was stolen and
hidden, and that ought to be found and returned
to its owners. Then it's <i>necessary</i> that we go
in this clubhouse and <i>we're going in</i>."</p>

<p>"Paul knows the way up through the cellar!
Let him get in at the window he got out of and
so go up the cellar stairs and open the door for
us. There's a key inside, likely," proposed
Billy.</p>

<p>"Say! how'd you like to take a run and jump
off the dock?" answered young Mr. Jones with
more fervor than elegance. "No, sir! We can
find some other window open!"</p>

<p>And Paul was right. A surprise awaited the
boys when they reached the west side of the
house. (The path from front to rear passed on
the east of the building.) The brush and a
couple of tall trees grew very close to the walls
at the westerly side. Phil was foremost as the
friends ventured in that direction.</p>

<p>"Look!" he cried suddenly. "A window
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
open, and more than that, it's smashed to
smithereens!"</p>

<p>Quite true it was. The fragments of glass
littered the parched and stunted grass. The
sash of the window was raised to its fullest
height. A freshly broken branch of a low bush,
close by, was evidence that the mischief had
been done but recently.</p>

<p>The boys could only guess by whom and for
what purpose the window had been shattered.
The thought came to them that Murky might
have been doing some investigating inside.
Possibly he was in the house at this very
minute. The idea was not a pleasant one to
contemplate.</p>

<p>"Gee whiz! I'd fade <i>away</i>&#8211;I'd shrink up to
a pale shadow and perish&#8211;actually perish, if
ever that fellow got hold of <i>me</i>!" said young
Mr. Jones. His voice indicated that perhaps
his exaggerated statement might not be so overdrawn
as it appeared.</p>

<p>"Come on! Give me a lift, somebody,"
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
exclaimed Way impatiently. Then, ignoring
Billy's prompt offer of a hand to boost him, up
he clambered and the next moment stood within.
Billy, Paul and Dave followed.</p>

<p>The air in the house was close and oppressive.
Outside the sun shone hot. Not even a
zephyr stirred the leaves. A bluejay shrieked
noisily, as if in protest at the visitors' conduct.
With something of that "fading away" feeling
Paul Jones had mentioned, the boys proceeded,
however, from room to room.</p>

<p>Downstairs they found everything to be quite
as has been described heretofore. The bucket
on the kitchen table beside which, on a former
occasion, the boys had seen a tiny pool of water,
was now empty and turned upside down. Other
little things, such as the tin dipper being inside
a cupboard and every drawer and every door
closed, suggested that whoever had occupied the
house had indeed gone away.</p>

<p>A door opened upon the stairs that led to the
second floor. It was closed but not locked. Up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
the dusty steps the boys went. They found
themselves in a hall off of which opened six
small bed-rooms. In each was a bedstead of one
kind or another, some of iron, some built of pine
lumber. There were mattresses on all the beds
but on only one was there other bedding. This
was in the room the window of which the boys
had more than once seen to be open.</p>

<p>A couple of blankets and a pillow were
thrown loosely over this mattress. The latter
was quite out of its proper position as if it had
been placed on the bedstead hurriedly. Looking
more closely the lads discovered that the other
mattresses were awry. Dave suggested that
someone had pulled them this way and that to
see if anything was hidden in or under them.
There was no telling whether he was right.</p>

<p>Between two of the tiny bed-rooms was a
bath-room. It contained a tub and washstand
only, but was quite nicely finished in painted
pine as, indeed, was all the second floor. There
were no towels, soap, brushes or any of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
usual paraphernalia of a bath-room in sight but
on a little shelf beneath the mirror were a shaving-mug
and brush.</p>

<p>"See! this has been used just lately! The
soap is still wet on the brush," Phil Way observed,
picking up that article. "Mr. Grandall
forgot it, I reckon."</p>

<p>"Grandall&#8211;your grandmother!" exclaimed
Worth quickly. "Look at the initial B, big as
life, on the cup!"</p>

<p>"Just the same, it was Grandall who was
here and the only questions are, what did he
come for and where has he went?" said Paul
Jones more positively than grammatically.</p>

<p>"Anyhow the shaving cup or the initial,
either one, is no sure sign of anything except
that someone was here, and we knew that before,"
said Way reflectively. "Quite likely the
reason the mug was left here was that it had
been here all along and did not belong to Grandall,"
he reasoned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>"Now you're shouting," spoke Jones with
emphasis.</p>

<p>At the end of the narrow hall was a small
room with a door opening upon a balcony.
Here the boys stepped out. The view of the
lake from this point was extremely pretty.
Under the glow of the sun the water shone like
silver. The green shores looked cool and delightful&#8211;far
cooler than they really were.</p>

<p>But they were lovely to the eye. Only one
tall, dead pine whose naked top and branches
rose gaunt and ghostly above the foliage of its
neighbors offered the slightest omen of the impending
danger in a scene so tranquil.</p>

<p>A high trellis on which the roses or some
vines had at some time clambered to this balcony
or porch roof where the boys now stood, offered
them an opportunity to climb down to the
ground. Only Billy chose this route. He
quickly reached the earth and went out to the
decaying remnants of the wharf while the
others resumed their search through the house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
But if he thought to discover any sign of whatever
the strange man threw into the water the
day before, he was disappointed.</p>

<p>Worth rejoined his friends in the clubhouse
living-room. Striking many matches to find the
way, they all descended the steep steps into the
cellar. Very little light entered this dark place.
One small window only was there beside the one
whose presence Paul Jones had found so convenient.</p>

<p>"Here's the place to look carefully," observed
Billy. "But I say, we are a pack of
mutton-heads! What if someone should come
into the house this minute? Tell you what!
You fellows dig around here and I'll stand
guard upstairs."</p>

<p>"I did think of such a plan but after seeing
that broken window, I concluded it wasn't
necessary," said Phil. "Whoever there might
be to disturb us now, has been through the house
ahead of us, I'm thinking. And it's my opinion
that we are too late coming here, anyhow. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
man who most likely found the twenty thousand
dollars is the one who cleared out last night."</p>

<p>Still Billy Worth insisted on going upstairs
to stand guard while the search of the dark
cellar went forward and the bluejay outside
harshly screamed its protests while the gaunt,
bare top of the old dead pine frowned ominously
across the lake.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>A GUEST AT NELS ANDERSON'S</span></h2>

<p>In vain did the youthful searchers examine
every foot of the cellar's earthen floor. The
thought that there, if anywhere, the treasure
might be buried, impressed them strongly and
right diligently did they apply themselves to
their task.</p>

<p>A few old boxes, a heavy pine table and a
combination cupboard and ice chest were substantially
all the cellar contained. All these
were explored and the ground beneath them
thoroughly inspected. "Nothing doing," was
the way Jones summed up the result, and if he
meant by this that every effort was fruitless,
as would appear likely, he was quite correct.</p>

<p>All through the automobile shed and all about
the club grounds the boys carried their exploring
and their minute inspection of whatever had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
the appearance of being a likely hiding place
for a suit-case containing twenty thousand dollars
of currency. Despite the temptation to experiment
with the engine that had been used
for pumping, to try the tools of the workbench,
or to put afloat the fishing skiff they discovered,
partly covered with lumber at the far end of
the shed, they molested nothing. They only
looked, but this they did thoroughly.</p>

<p>It was noon and Chip Slider, keeping camp
alone, had become anxious and worried for the
safety of his new friends before the latter made
their appearance at the lean-to. He looked wistfully
from one to another and read in their
faces the answer to the question in his mind.</p>

<p>All hands fell to with preparations for dinner.
Chip had busied himself with the gathering of
an immense quantity of dry wood, but fresh
water must be brought from the well in the
sandy beach, potatoes must be washed, peeled
and sliced for frying; bacon must be sliced;
eggs and butter brought from the "refrigerator,"
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
also,&#8211;something for everyone to do,
in short, under Chef Billy's competent direction.</p>

<p>Whether Murky, as well as the wearer of the
golfing cap, that is, the recent tenant of the clubhouse,
had departed from the woods, was a
question all tried in vain to answer satisfactorily
as the boys sat at dinner. And if one, or
both, had or had not really gone for good, was
also an inquiry, the answer to which could not
be discovered.</p>

<p>Paul Jones proposed that a visit be made to
the den Murky had made for himself. Slider
could show the way. Approaching carefully, it
might be quite easy to discover the tramp's
presence or absence without danger of being
seen by him. Billy Worth interposed with the
suggestion that a trip to Staretta was more important.
Provisions were needed, there would
surely be some mail at the office and the letters
written yesterday should be posted.</p>

<p>"Yes, and stop at Anderson's, too!" put in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
MacLester. "I'm mighty suspicious of that individual,
<i>myself</i>,&#8211;'specially after Jonesy's experience!"</p>

<p>With these good reasons for going to town
confronting them, together with the fact that
the use of their car was always a source of keen
enjoyment to the Auto Boys, it seems quite
needless to state what they decided to do.</p>

<p>Paul inspected the gasoline supply and added
the contents of a ten gallon can kept as a reserve,
not forgetting to put the now empty can
in the tonneau to be refilled at Staretta. Dave
looked to the quantity of oil in the reservoir and
decided none was needed. Phil in the meantime
was examining nuts and bolts with a practiced
eye&#8211;a hardly necessary proceeding for
every part of the beloved machine had been put
in the pink of order on Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>"Worth's turn to drive," said Jones. "So
go on, Bill. I'll wash dishes. Gee whiz! If
there's anything I'd rather do than wash
dishes&#8211;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>"Yes, the list would fill a book!" Worth
broke in. "You go ahead, Paul, I'm going to
stay in camp. Going to cook up a little stuff
and all I ask of you fellows is to bring these
things from Fraley's."</p>

<p>Worth passed over a list he had been writing
and, with a show of an extreme reluctance he
did not feel, Paul climbed up to the driver's
seat. Phil Way meantime was protesting that
he would remain to guard camp. Billy would
not listen, but said in an undertone that Way
must go along to make Chip feel comfortable
and contented.</p>

<p>For Slider had shown for Way a fondness
that was both beautiful and pathetic. It was as
if he realized that he had truly found the answer
to the musing questions of his lifetime at last.
This was true with regard to all four of the
chums but most especially was Chip already
devoted to Phil.</p>

<p>With MacLester up beside Paul, and Way
and the now clean and well-fed boy of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
woods in the tonneau, the graceful automobile
threaded its route among the trees. With roads
averaging from fair to good, an hour would
have taken the travelers to Staretta easily.
With six or seven miles of woodland trail, then
an equal distance of but moderately good going
before getting fairly out of the forest, Paul took
an hour and a half for the trip. There was no
need to hurry, he said, but just the same as soon
as the wheels struck the good, level earth not
far from town the speedometer shot up to
"30."</p>

<p>Link Fraley was found, busy as usual, this
time packing eggs into a shipping case; but for
once he stopped working the moment he caught
sight of his callers. Sometimes he had allowed
his father to wait on the boys as they did their
buying, but today he told the senior member of
the house he would attend to them himself.</p>

<p>"Been wantin' to see ye," said Link cordially.
"Anything new back in the timber?"</p>

<p>The young storekeeper's voice had a peculiar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
inflection and his face bore an expression that
answered "yes" to his own question.</p>

<p>"A little; that is, we have something to tell
and something to ask about, as usual," Phil
replied. "Here's the list of things Billy
wanted. If you'll get them ready while we go
over to the post-office&#8211;we want to have a good,
old talk with you."</p>

<p>"Been annexing part of our lumber country
population, I see," remarked Fraley in an undertone,
glancing toward Slider who had waited
at the door.</p>

<p>Phil nodded.</p>

<p>"Want to look a little out," Fraley continued,
with a shake of his head and a tone of doubt;
but he turned away at once to find the baking
soda, item number one in Billy Worth's list,
and his young friends betook themselves to the
post-office.</p>

<p>At the rear door of Fraley &amp; Son's establishment
was a platform to facilitate the loading
and unloading of freight. It was roofed over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
with pine boards that gave protection from sun
or rain and, as whatever slight breeze there
might be blowing was to be found here, there
was no better place in Staretta for a chat on a
hot day. Seated on kegs of nails on this platform,
upon their return to the store, the Auto
Boys told Mr. Fraley, Jr., the main facts of
their discoveries since last seeing him.</p>

<p>Link listened with the most sober attention.</p>

<p>"I honestly don't know," said he at last,
"whether to take much stock in the story of the
suit-case full of swag or not. But it does look
as if things in general pointed in that direction.
I didn't believe, at first, that your neighbor up
there by the lake was anything more than one of
these vacation tourists that often go trapsing
'round, even if he wasn't just a chap doing
some shooting out of season. But I'm pretty
well satisfied now that a lot more than ever <i>I</i>
suspected has been going on. Listen here!"</p>

<p>With this Link took from between the leaves
of a notebook a neatly folded clipping from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
a newspaper. Clearing his throat, while he
opened the clipping and smoothed it over his
knee, he proceeded to read aloud.</p>

<p>The newspaper item was an Associated Press
dispatch dated from &#8213;, the home city of
the Longknives Club. Its substance was that
Lewis Grandall, teller of the Commercial Trust
&amp; Banking Company of that city, was missing
from his home. His absence was supposed to
be on account of an investigation the Grand
Jury had been making in connection with certain
city contracts in which he had been interested,
not as an officer of the bank, but personally.
The disappearance of Grandall, the dispatch
stated, had caused a small run on the
bank and general uneasiness among the depositors
and stockholders. This had later been
quieted by a signed statement from the directors
stating positively that the company's
interests were not involved in any of the missing
teller's personal business affairs.</p>

<p>"From which it would seem to a man up a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
tree that one certain Grandall was finding Opal
Lake atmosphere good for his constitution,"
remarked Link Fraley as he finished reading.
"But," he went on, "it looks to me a lot more
as if he had come up here for his health, so to
speak, than to hunt for a bag of the coin of the
realm that somebody stole three years ago.
The point is, that if the twenty thousand dollars
that the road builders should have got, but
didn't, was put through a nice, neat and orderly
system of being stolen here and there till it all
got back to Grandall again, he ain't been letting
it lie around the woods and drawin' no interest
nearly three years now."</p>

<p>"By ginger! I knew that fellow at the clubhouse
was Grandall, all right," spoke up Paul
Jones. "And you must have hit the nail on the
head when you told us in the first place that
Nels Anderson was mixed up with him in cheating
that whole army of men out of their pay,"
the boy added briskly.</p>

<p>"That doesn't dovetail with what we already
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
know about Murky getting the money first and
then Slider taking it from him and its getting
back to Grandall again," said Paul thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! that wouldn't make much difference,"
said Fraley. "Grandall was playing
everybody against everybody else for the benefit
of Grandall. That was his general reputation,
too&#8211;downright deceitful! Never knew
just where he'd hook up or how long he'd be
either one thing or the other&#8211;your best friend,
or your worst enemy."</p>

<p>Whether Grandall had been frightened away
from the clubhouse by finding Murky to be in
the vicinity, or for other reasons had deemed
the lake an unsafe hiding place, the boys and
Fraley debated for some time. As they at last
prepared to go, Link called Phil to one side.
He did not like the notion of Chip Slider being
taken up by the Auto Boys in any very intimate
way, he declared. He had known the elder
Slider, he said, and there were a lot of better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
men in Michigan than he and a lot of better
boys than his son was likely to be.</p>

<p>Phil told Fraley he was surely mistaken with
regard to Chip, at least, but promised he would
be on his guard in case he found any deceptive
tendencies developing in the young gentleman
in question.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Paul and Dave had driven to
the general repair shop at which their gasoline
was purchased and all were soon ready
for the road. With a steady purr their quiet,
powerful car left the town behind. What a perfect
machine it was! And what its owners
would do were anything to happen to deprive
them of its ever-ready services&#8211;the very
thought would have been quite unbearable. It
is a wise plan, indeed, that none of us can see
even a few short hours forward, or know certainly
the changes a single day may bring.</p>

<p>An adequate excuse for stopping at the lowly
home of the Andersons had not been forgotten
by the chums while in town. Choosing to call
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
there on their homeward way rather than when
on the road in from the woods, they now had
with them an extra half dozen of bananas.</p>

<p>Mrs. Anderson sat on a rickety chair at the
shady side of the little house vainly trying to
get a breath of fresh air while doing some
mending, as the Thirty came to a stop near her.
Hastily she arose and went around to a back
door.</p>

<p>Phil was already out of the car and was
walking up to the low front step&#8211;the dwelling
was without a porch&#8211;when through the open
doors he saw Mrs. Anderson enter at the rear.
She spoke some words in her native tongue the
boy did not understand; but directly Nels Anderson
stepped forward from the kitchen to
meet him while at the same time another man
glided silently out of the door at which the
woman had just come in. The man wore a
golfing cap. If he was not the identical person
who had lately occupied the clubhouse then Phil
Way was vastly mistaken.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>"Wouldn't you like some bananas?" asked
Way pleasantly. "We thought likely you did
not get to town often and maybe would relish a
taste of these," and with a friendly smile he
tendered his offering.</p>

<p>With only a word of thanks and that spoken
rather indifferently, Phil thought, the great
Swede accepted the fruit. Still holding the
paper sack under his arm he said he wished the
camp at the lake only good luck but he thought
it dangerous for the boys to stay there. It
would be more so as time went on, unless a pouring
rain came very soon to wet the ground and
foliage. The probability of forest fires near by
was becoming serious. Two severe blazes had
already occurred. He pointed away to the west
and south, calling attention to smoke that he
said he could see over the distant tree tops.</p>

<p>Oddly enough Phil could see no smoke, at
least nothing more than usual. The horizon in
this region had always a hazy, smoky tinge, he
had observed. Nevertheless he said he appreciated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
the suggestion and added that a few days
more would see the breaking of camp at the
lake, anyway. It was in his thoughts to ask
what Anderson himself would do in the event
of a forest fire. The tiny clearing, he thought,
would be very little protection if the flames
came near it.</p>

<p>But Way refrained from speaking of this.
There was a matter of more importance about
which he wished to inquire. "Do you know if
there is anyone staying at the clubhouse at the
lake, Mr. Anderson?" Thus did the boy frame
his question. Receiving no answer but a shake
of the head, Phil then continued. "Because,"
said he, "it would be right convenient if we
could get permission to use the workbench in
the automobile house. We'd do no harm to
anything."</p>

<p>"I tank yo better let him bay," Nels answered,
the least bit sharply. But more kindly
he went on to say that he knew of no one being
at the clubhouse now and that while the property
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
was not his, the best advice he could offer
was not to meddle with anything in the buildings
or on the grounds.</p>

<p>Quite baffled by the Swede's apparent friendliness,
yet certain that he was practicing deception,
Phil returned to the machine. He told
fully of the conversation with Anderson while
the car purred forward.</p>

<p>Without exception the boys agreed with him
that the talk of forest fires was like the denial
of all knowledge of the clubhouse being occupied&#8211;simple
deception, and nothing else.
Clinching the soundness of this reasoning also,
was the certain fact that the recent clubhouse
tenant was now Anderson's guest.</p>

<p>"Grandall! He saw Murky or Murky saw
him! He must have guessed that Murky has
found out how he had been given the double
cross, and was after him in dead earnest. Result:
Grandall, in cahoots with Anderson for
some bad business or other, packs his little
satchel and goes to the Swede's to stay."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>So did Dave MacLester reason the whole
matter out. Chip Slider nodded his endorsement
of these conclusions.</p>

<p>"They've got that stolen money, so they
have!" he said. "We could have them arrested,"
he added, only the word he used was
"pinched."</p>

<p>"And we will! <i>Mark that!</i>" said Phil Way.</p>

<p>Yet it often does happen that young gentlemen,
and older ones, too, make assertions which,
in the end, lead not where it was thought they
would do at all.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>"WHO SAID I WAS AFRAID?"</span></h2>

<p>For Billy's information the developments of
the afternoon were told and retold when all
were again together in the camp. There was
much discussion, too, concerning the advisability
of causing the arrest of the man in the
golfing cap and, possibly, Nels Anderson as
well.</p>

<p>Meantime Billy had announced supper. It
was a most tempting little meal with warm soda
biscuits and honey as the chief items. The
former Chef Worth had prepared during the
afternoon and the latter he had caused to be
brought from Fraley's in anticipation of his
having the biscuits ready.</p>

<p>No doubt it was at the comfortable old farm
home of Tyler Gleason that the four chums had
developed a marked fondness for the delicacies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
mentioned, as readers of "The Auto Boys" will
remember; but be that as it may, they enjoyed
the change from the usual camp fare hugely.</p>

<p>As has been stated, there was no little discussion
as to whether the Staretta officers should
be asked to arrest and hold the stranger at Nels
Anderson's until he could be positively identified
as Grandall, the dishonest Longknives'
treasurer. Phil Way declared firmly that this
must be done.</p>

<p>"Personally, I don't see any sense in mixing
up in an affair that doesn't really matter much
to us!" exclaimed MacLester. He had been
quiet for a long time. When he did speak it
was with hard emphasis in his voice. "Murky
and Grandall and the whole outfit that got away
with the cash the road builders should have
had&#8211;well! we don't usually have much to do
with such people and no good will come of our
beginning now," the boy added.</p>

<p>For a moment Chip Slider's face wore a look
of anger. Perhaps he thought Dave's latter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
remark was aimed at him. But he said nothing.</p>

<p>Phil looked at MacLester in a significant manner,
as if he would caution him against speaking
so. Yet, "No use growling, Davy," were
the words he said. Then he added that such a
thing as duty must be taken into consideration;
that one who has knowledge of a crime and conceals
it is regarded by the law the same as if he
actually shielded the wrong-doer.</p>

<p>"Gee whiz! I should say so," piped Paul
Jones with shrill emphasis. "We'd be a pack
of softies if we let Grandall and Murky, and
the rest, get away, after all we know now!"</p>

<p>When Billy also joined heartily with Phil and
Paul in urging that the Staretta officers be
notified of the presence of both Grandall and
Murky, MacLester no longer held back. How
best to go about the matter, however, became
immediately a problem.</p>

<p>Dave wanted to telegraph the police in Grandall's
home town and learn if the man was
really wanted by them. The hearsay evidence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
possessed by Slider, with regard to the stolen
twenty thousand dollars, he declared, wasn't
worth much until it could be backed up by more
hard, cold facts than were thus far in hand.</p>

<p>"Suppose we were to go back to Staretta and
have a talk with the sheriff or chief-of-police or
constable&#8211;whatever they have there in the
brass buttons line&#8211;tonight," proposed Billy.
He was resting comfortably, his back against a
tree, while Phil and Dave, with Slider's help,
were washing the dishes.</p>

<p>Having had a quiet but busy afternoon young
Mr. Worth was quite ready for an evening out.</p>

<p>"Sure pop!" Paul Jones exclaimed. "How
do we know but that Grandall fellow is right
on his way now to fly the coop?&#8211;and that's
just what he is, most likely."</p>

<p>"Go ahead! I'll keep camp&#8211;Slider and I,"
put in MacLester quickly. Perhaps Dave was
anxious to show Chip some friendly attention
to make amends for the unpleasant words
spoken a little while before. Perhaps Chip, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
well, wished to show that he harbored no ill
feeling. At any rate, "Yes, let him an' me do
up the rest of them dishes an' the rest of you
get started sooner," the lad proposed.</p>

<p>The thought that Slider's presence, to tell
the officers in person what he knew of the stolen
payroll money, would be highly desirable, did
not occur even to Phil, usually quick to see such
things. The plan was put into effect at once.
With headlights throwing a long, white glow
before them Billy, Phil and Paul said good-bye.
Worth was at the wheel, one finger on the
throttle, and at truly hazardous speed he sent
the steady Thirty in and out among the trees
that bordered the narrow trail.</p>

<p>"Goodness, Bill! What's the hurry?" ejaculated
Phil, alone in the tonneau and getting
more of a shaking up than he relished.</p>

<p>"Oh, he thinks there's so many trees around
it won't hurt if he does tear out a few of the
big, old ones <i>that are all done growing anyway</i>,"
Paul added grimly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>For it most generally is true that the driver
is much less nervous than his passengers. A
chuckle was Worth's only answer, but he did
retard the throttle some and with less gas the
machine at once slowed down.</p>

<p>The evening was close and warm as the previous
night had been. The moon had not yet
risen but, knowing every part of the road, Billy
let the car pick up speed again directly he
reached the broader, straighter path.</p>

<p>"We'll get this robbery business into the
hands of the bluecoats; then home for us,"
called Phil from his seat behind. He would
not willingly have admitted it, but he believed
he smelled smoke. Also he was thinking of a
clipping enclosed from home that morning telling
of very destructive forest fires in other
sections of this northern part of Michigan.</p>

<p>"I guess so," Worth answered. "It's a
shame to punish a car on such roads as these.
The lake is all right and being by ourselves
is just what we wanted, but&#8211;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>The sentence was not finished. It was a way
Billy had of leaving some things unsaid. In
this case the road told all the driver had left
unspoken. It was certainly "no boulevard,"
as young Mr. Jones had expressively remarked
the first time the chums traversed it.</p>

<p>The dim glow of a kitchen lamp was the only
sign of life the boys noticed at Nels Anderson's
little house as they passed. They did not
pause. There would be no occasion for
them to visit the place again, they had decided,
but whether correctly or not will in due time
be apparent. Just now the main thing was to
reach Staretta before everyone, Link Fraley
in particular, would most likely be found in
bed.</p>

<p>True it was that the little town fell asleep
early. "And what's to stop it?" Paul Jones
had once asked. Yet the lights were still burning
in Fraley's store and at the post-office, which
was in the little shoe store opposite, when the
Thirty rumbled down the main street.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>Mr. Lincoln Fraley, standing in the doorway,
went down the steps to meet the boys
as they drove up. Something had happened,
he was quite sure, to bring them back so soon;
for, not being familiar with the rapid traveling
an automobile affords, he had no idea of
the lads having been to Opal Lake and back
since he last saw them.</p>

<p>"It's time to close up anyhow. Come take
a ride," Billy invited.</p>

<p>Mr. Fraley said his father would attend to
closing the store and, going in leisurely for
his hat&#8211;lest he be suspected of a too lively
interest in the prospect of an automobile ride
if he hurried, perhaps&#8211;he presently seated himself
in the tonneau beside Phil. As Billy drove
slowly forward Way told of the discovery of
Grandall at Anderson's. Briefly he stated the
intention of causing the man's arrest and the
capture of Murky, as well, which, he was certain,
could be quite readily accomplished.</p>

<p>"Well now!" said Mr. Fraley in a musing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
tone, and, "if it don't beat me!" he slowly
added in the same slow and reflective manner.</p>

<p>"But great land of belly aches!" Paul Jones
chirped protestingly, "don't you see what we
want? We want to know whom we must see&#8211;sheriff&#8211;judge&#8211;chiropodist&#8211;whoever
it may be
to get these chaps into jail and nail down those
twenty thousand pieces of eight!"</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry," spoke Fraley with
greater animation. "What I had in mind was
that Nels Anderson surely is consorting with
Grandall and probably has been all along. I'm
the more sure of it because the Swede was in
the store early this morning and bought a
lot more stuff than we've ever sold him at one
time before. I didn't wait on him and didn't
know of it at the time you were here this afternoon.
My father just happened to mention it
at supper. Pretty plain now where Nels got
the money and plain as daylight, as well, that
he expects to have company for some time,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
which accounts for the stack of provisions he
took back with him."</p>

<p>"All the more reason&#8211;" Phil began, meaning
to continue, "that we should get in touch
with the officers at once."</p>

<p>Link anticipated what he would have said.
"No," he interrupted, "You don't need be in
any hurry. And you do want to bring that
Slider boy with you when you come to talk
with the sheriff. Your evidence is mostly
second-hand anyway. You don't want to give
it to the county officers third-hand and fourth-hand
when it ain't necessary. I'm watchin'
the papers every day and I'll get some more
news about Grandall's running away from the
Grand Jury and his bank. Just you wait."</p>

<p>There was a lurking suspicion in Billy
Worth's mind that Fraley wished to wait until
he, himself, could communicate with the
officers, but he said nothing. Phil and Paul
were disappointed, too, that their friend would
not advise immediate action.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>The boys talked of those matters after they
had left Link at his home,&#8211;the large, plain
house with flower beds in front, near the store.
But they had headed the car toward Opal Lake
now and their conclusion was to continue homeward.
They would do nothing until the next
afternoon, at least, at which time, it had been
agreed, they were to see Fraley again. They
would find out, meanwhile, and be able to inform
the officers, whether Mr. Murky was still
"at home" at the rude shelter where Chip had
seen him.</p>

<p>The light was yet burning at the humble
Anderson dwelling as the friends passed on
their homeward way. They thought they saw
the figures of two men sitting just outside the
door where a faint breath of air might now be
stirring, but could not be sure. They were
quite satisfied the guest of the family was still
there and for the present this knowledge was
sufficient.</p>

<p>As the headlights' glare swept the camp at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
Opal Lake Chip Slider was for a moment seen
making frantic gestures. He seemed to wish
the boys to hurry. Phil almost fell over the
excited youth as he jumped down from a forward
seat a few seconds later, for Chip had
seized a front fender as if he would thereby
help to halt the car more quickly.</p>

<p>"I can't help it," cried Slider with anxiety,
"and I don't want to be scared over nothin'&#8211;but
it's Dave! He went over the lake in the
boat an' that's the last I seen him. It was
somebody hollerin'&#8211;somebody hollerin' from
t'other side!"</p>

<p>With real alarm the three friends heard the
disconnected words of the frightened Chip. In
a chorus they demanded to know all about the
matter, their own language hardly more clear
than Slider's. Phil was first to gain composure
enough to call for quiet. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Now, Chip, tell us precisely what happened
and how long ago. I guess Mac could get
himself out of any kind of pickle he'd be likely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
to get into," he added with vastly more confidence
than he felt. "Go ahead now, and don't
be so rattled."</p>

<p>It was only a half hour or thereabouts after
the automobile had gone, the boy stated, his
tones still filled with alarm, when he and MacLester
heard cries from across the lake. They
had washed and put away the dishes left to
their attention, and were sitting down by the
water, thinking it cooler on the beach. Some
refuse they had thrown on the campfire blazed
up, making quite a bright light. Like a distant
whistle of a railroad engine there came a little
later a long, loud cry, "Hello-o!"</p>

<p>"Well, hello!" MacLester cried in answer,
Chip stated, telling his story clearly, but so
slowly Paul was fairly bursting with impatience.
There was more "hollering" of hellos, the lad
went on, then the voice from over the water
asked, "Could ye put me up fer the night?"
Dave answered, "Yes, come on over." Replies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
came back, "Have ye a boat?" and "Could ye
not kindly row across fer me?"</p>

<p>The outcome of the whole matter was that
MacLester remarked to Chip that they would
wait until Phil and the others returned.</p>

<p>"'Would you be afraid to cross over alone?'
I asked him," said Slider, "an' I meant just
a fair question, but he turned quick as a cat.</p>

<p>"'Who said I was afraid?' he spoke pretty
sharp. Then he hollered out to the party that
had been yellin', 'Keep singing out to guide
me an' I'll paddle over to you.'</p>

<p>"He got in the boat and started and never a
word he said. Every minute or two I heard
the other one and Dave hollerin' out to each
other till about the time when the boat could
have touched t'other shore. Then it was still
an' I ain't heard a word since. I've yelled an'
yelled an' kept the fire blazin' up to steer 'em
straight to this here side, but never a word
of answer did I get an' hide nor hair of 'em
I ain't seen."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>"Could it have been that fellow Murky?
Would you know his voice?" asked Billy.</p>

<p>Chip shook his head. He was quite sure the
voice was not that of the person mentioned.</p>

<p>"He could disguise his voice easy enough,"
spoke Paul dejectedly. "Dave could swim all
night, but the other fellow&#8211;"</p>

<p>"Now wait a minute!" interrupted Phil
briskly, feeling that he simply <i>must</i> face the
situation with courage, bad as it might be. He
hurried down to the beach. Loudly and again
and again he called, "Oh! Dave," and "Oh,
David MacLester!"</p>

<p>No answer came to his despairing cries.
Softly the water lapped the sand at his feet.
In the distance the frogs were croaking. Darkness
too deep to let even the outlines of the
farther shore be seen hung over Opal Lake and
distinctly on the light breeze now springing up
came the odor of burning pine.</p>

<p>"If we only had another boat!" murmured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
Paul. "There's the skiff down by the clubhouse,"
he meekly suggested.</p>

<p>"Why," said Billy, "our old boat was safe
enough! I can't believe they ever left the other
side. That's where we've got to get to. We
can go around the east end of the lake in
about half an hour's walk."</p>

<p>Phil Way was never so perplexed&#8211;never so
at a loss to know what to do. Looked to as
the leader and the captain in all things, he
usually was quick to suggest, quick to decide
and quite generally for the best. His heart&#8211;his
nerve&#8211;whatever it is that keeps the mind
steady and alert at such time&#8211;came nearer
failing him now than ever before.</p>

<p>All the boys, Chip included, were on the
beach. Several times Phil's cries had been
repeated by the others. At last&#8211;</p>

<p>"We must get the skiff," Way declared. "If
Dave's on dry land we can find him when daylight
comes, if not before. But if he's holding
on to an upset boat, though too weak to answer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
us, maybe, we've got to find him right
off."</p>

<p>Leaving Paul to guard the camp and keep a
bright fire burning, Billy and Phil, with Chip accompanying
them, were soon running toward the
old clubhouse. They carried the oil lamps from
the car and thus made good progress. But the
skiff was found dry and seamy. It would be
necessary for one or another to keep bailing
constantly, they saw, the moment they launched
her.</p>

<p>And where were the oars? In their excitement
the boys had not noticed the absence of
this very necessary equipment until the boat
was in the water. With frantic haste they
searched here and there. The rays of their
lamps were far from powerful and close inspection
of each nook and corner must be made
to see what might be there.</p>

<p>The excessive stillness, the atmosphere of
loneliness and melancholy that hung always
about the Point and its deserted buildings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
seemed intensified tonight. The shadows cast
by the two lamps seemed unnaturally gaunt
and ghostly. With all their activity the three
lads could not but be impressed by these things,
but they were too occupied to be frightened
by them.</p>

<p>"At last!" Phil's voice came low but quick.
In another moment he drew a pair of oars
from behind an unused door whose lower panels
a charge of buckshot had shattered, apparently,
and which was now stored in a corner of the
automobile shed.</p>

<p>"Whatever will we bail with?" asked Billy,
finding the skiff already to have taken considerable
water.</p>

<p>"I know," came a prompt answer and Slider
disappeared in the darkness. From behind the
garage he brought in a few seconds two empty
tin cans. "There's no end of 'em among some
weeds back there if we need more," he said.</p>

<p>"No! You keep bailing, Chip, and you, Billy,
hold the lights! Off we go!" and Phil shoved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
away the moment all were fairly on board.
From the black shore line to the east they could
see the campfire shedding a bright light for a
little distance over the waters; but except for
this and the rays of the auto lamps Worth held
the darkness was like pitch.</p>

<p>"Paul's blaze will be our light-house. We
want to hit toward the middle of the lake, just
about opposite the camp, then straight over to
the far side," spoke Way, breathing fast.
"Keep me guided right, Bill." He was pulling
hard.</p>

<p>The incoming water kept Slider more than
busy. With a can in each hand he scooped to
right and left. Worth found it necessary to
give Phil very few directions for Way was a
splendid oarsman and the light craft swept
forward rapidly.</p>

<p>Every minute or two Billy sang out MacLester's
name. Eagerly he scanned the water
as far as the lamp rays fell, but heard nothing,
saw nothing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>Not until the north shore was almost reached
did Phil slow down. Then he let the boat drift
forward easily while watching for a landing
place. "Raise the lamp higher," he called over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>Billy did so and as the skiff floated nearer
the quite steep bank rising from the water at
this point, there came suddenly into the lighted
circle a flat bottomed fishing boat. It was the
scow MacLester had used and it was empty.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>IS NO NEWS GOOD NEWS?</span></h2>

<p>The fishing boat lay drifting, but only three
or four yards from shore. Had Dave effected
a landing or, in the darkness, had he tried and
failed? That which quite possibly, even probably,
had happened was a thought that filled
even Phil with apprehension and despair.</p>

<p>"Light the way! I'll pull close in shore,"
he said, trying hard to swallow the lump in his
throat.</p>

<p>The bank where the skiff's nose soon touched
was steep, yet easy to be climbed as its height
was only a few feet. But there was no sign
that anyone had been near it. Otherwise the
dry earth would have shown the imprints of
toes or heels. This was quickly proved when,
Phil steadying the boat and with a root and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
straggling shrub to help him, Billy crept quickly
to the top.</p>

<p>"Still, we don't know just where Dave may
have run in. It's queer that he let the scow
drift, if&#8211;even if he expected to go right back,"
said Worth in a hushed tone, from the edge of
the low bluff.</p>

<p>"Queer what became of the man who called
him over here, if such a thing as Mac falling
into the water may have happened," observed
Phil. "And Dave could swim&#8211;why, almost
across the lake, if he had to! He could save
himself if there was nobody pulling him down."</p>

<p>Throwing Billy a line by which to hold the
boat, Way and Slider followed him up the bank.
They walked some distance in each direction
along the shore but the feeble light of the oil
lamps showed no trace of David MacLester nor
yet of the mysterious person who had summoned
him. The thought, "crooked work," was in
the minds of all three.</p>

<p>"After all, it's the water I'm most afraid of.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
If Dave fell and hurt himself or was pushed
into the lake&#8211;but never mind. One of us must
go back to Paul and the others will have to&#8211;look
further," said Phil at last.</p>

<p>Billy was chosen to return to camp. What
Phil meant to do, with Slider's help, was drag
the lake in this vicinity. If Dave had gone to
the bottom, due to some accident or injury, it
might not yet be too late to save his life. Such
things had been done, Way said, but he spoke
without his usual confidence and very, very
gloomily.</p>

<p>Returning to the skiff, the boys ran along
side the fishing boat and drew the latter to
shore. Phil and Chip tied her to a projecting
root and Worth bade them good-bye.</p>

<p>With a long, steady stroke he pulled for the
southern shore and the bright light blazing
there. But it is one thing to row for the fun
of it, when the sunlight dances on the ripples,
and quite another to cross a strange body of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
water&#8211;and alone&#8211;when inky darkness spreads
everywhere.</p>

<p>The swelling of the wood had now pretty well
stopped the skiff's leaking, yet again and again
Billy paused to bail out. The unpleasant
thought that he would find the water pouring
in too fast for his best efforts harassed him.
He could not see, so he often put down his hand
to feel and thus make sure the boat was not
filling. So at last did he float into the rays of
the campfire's light and a minute later stand
telling Paul the unhappy discoveries made.</p>

<p>The thought that Dave and the strange man,
having found their boat drifting beyond reach,
may have started to walk around the head of
the lake and so come on foot to the camp, had
suggested itself to Billy as he rowed. Mentioning
this to Paul he set out, with a small
camp lamp in hand, to explore the shore in
the direction indicated.</p>

<p>Thus left alone again Jones was the most
dejected and sorrowful young fellow one could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
easily imagine. To keep the fire blazing high
was all he could do to be of any possible assistance.
Inactivity was hard for him to bear at
any time. Especially was it hard when his
thoughts were so disturbed and his anxiety so
great.</p>

<p>It was coming daylight when at last Jones
saw the fishing boat approaching. In it were
Phil and Billy and Chip; for Worth, having
traversed the whole upper border of the lake
without result other than to tire himself exceedingly,
had spent all the latter part of the
night with Way and Slider.</p>

<p>To the great astonishment of these two he
had suddenly appeared to them out of the darkness.
He had broken his lamp to bits in a
painful tumble into a dry water course the
undergrowth concealed.</p>

<p>Several hours the three lads had then spent
alternately dragging the lake's bottom with
hooked poles, looking up and down the steep
bank for footprints, and here and there going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
some distance back into the woods vainly searching.
Even before the dawn appeared their
lamps went out. With difficulty they had then
embarked for the opposite shore. Daylight
came as wearily they worked their heavy craft
forward.</p>

<p>The one hopeful fact the boys found in a
sorrowful review of the situation, as they
stretched their tired limbs upon the ground,
was that the dragging of the lake in the vicinity
where Dave's empty boat was found had been
without result.</p>

<p>"We'll get some rest&#8211;a few minutes, anyway,
and a cup of coffee, then we'll see what
daylight will do to help us," suggested Phil.</p>

<p>Yet it was scarcely more than sunrise when
the search was resumed. Crossing to the north
shore in the skiff, Billy and Paul set about a
minute inspection of the dry earth of the bank
and of the woods for a long distance up and
down the water's edge. Leaving Slider in camp,
Phil made the detour of the east shore on foot.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>As Way drew near the scene of the fruitless
work of the night he discovered close in shore
an old log lying just under the water's surface
and partially imbedded in the earth of the
bank. A short, stubby branch projected its wet
and slimy tip an inch or two above the water.
A slivered end that had risen considerably
higher was freshly broken. Not completely detached,
it lay almost level with the water's
surface.</p>

<p>But a more interesting discovery still was
unmistakable footprints in the dry earth. The
footprints were made by MacLester. Of this
Phil was certain. It was to the large projecting
splinter, broken from the old log, that Dave
had tied the boat, perhaps. Yet how had the
slow and heavy craft broken from its mooring?
And what was of vastly more consequence what
had then happened to Mac?</p>

<p>The scene of Way's discoveries was some
distance from the spot in which the fishing
boat had been found. It was farther to the east,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
also, than search along the bank had been carried
during the night; but the lake at this point
had been dragged again.</p>

<p>Examining the ground carefully, Phil sought
to find some further evidence concerning the
missing boy's movements. He discovered
nothing of importance. Going forward, then, to
Billy and Paul, now working toward the westerly
end of the lake, he told them of his discoveries.
Quickly they returned with him.</p>

<p>To make their search thorough the three boys
undertook to inspect the ground covering a
wide area at this point where they believed
their friend had landed. Several hundred feet
from the water they made an interesting discovery.
In a little patch of earth, made bare
by the burrowing of some small animal, there
were three footprints. One showed the mark
of a shoe such as Dave MacLester wore. Two
other tracks were broad and heavy&#8211;the imprints
of coarser footwear.</p>

<p>It was a marked relief to the three chums
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
to find such good cause to believe MacLester
was not drowned; but what in the world had become
of him? Had he been enticed away? Had
he been taken captive by some unknown enemy?</p>

<p>In vain the search for other footprints,&#8211;anything
to cast additional light on the grievous
problems,&#8211;was carried further. Every prospect
ended in disappointment. It was long
after noon. The boys had penetrated several
miles into the woods and they at last acknowledged
themselves completely baffled.</p>

<p>Murky was a name they often mentioned as
they counseled together. They could think of
no one else who might have a reason for doing
them all an injury. But why should Murky
wish to make Dave or any of them a prisoner?
His only motive could be that he feared they
were searching for the stolen money he considered
as his own. He had warned Chip Slider
to keep off that track, the boys knew.</p>

<p>"We'll hunt till dark, then if we have no
success and get no word at all, we will get the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
sheriff and a lot of men from Staretta! We
will find Dave and it won't be very pleasant
for Murky or whoever is to blame for this,"
declared Way. "There's more back of the
whole matter than we can make out&#8211;more than
we can even guess right now, you'll see!"</p>

<p>The boys returned to camp. The thought had
come to them many times that Chip Slider might
know a great deal more than he had told. They
remembered Link Fraley's words about the
boy. But they could not accuse him without
any ground for doing so. They could find no
evidence that Mac's disappearance had not
occurred just as Chip had told them. And he
had twice repeated the whole story the same as
in the beginning.</p>

<p>It was a heart-sick group that ate a hasty
lunch of bread and coffee in the woodland
camp. Now for the first time, however, Paul
told of the lonely time he had had during the
long night&#8211;told of the noises he had heard in
the distance, along the beach. He was quite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
sure that bears and deer, as well, to say nothing
of numerous smaller creatures, had come to the
lake to drink and bathe. He believed they
would have come quite close to the shack but,
for the bright fire he kept blazing.</p>

<p>Ordinarily the boys would have found great
interest in such a subject; but today their spirits
were at too low an ebb, their minds too disturbed
over the unaccountable loss of their
friend to permit their attention being otherwise
occupied.</p>

<p>All except Billy set out after lunch to learn
whether the suspected Murky had deserted his
usual hiding place. Slider was the guide. He
led the others quite directly to the logs where
the tramp had made his bed and headquarters.</p>

<p>The fellow had apparently departed. He had
left the pan and other utensils taken from the
boys' camp but the blankets he had carried with
him. They were nowhere to be seen, at any
rate.</p>

<p>More certain than ever, then, that it was this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
unscrupulous villain who had decoyed Dave
across the lake and in some manner forced
their friend to accompany him, the lads hurried
back to camp.</p>

<p>Again they rowed to the north shore and with
utmost determination plunged into the hot, close
woods.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE LONG-HIDDEN TREASURE IS UNCOVERED</span></h2>

<p>And now, while the weary young searchers
were hastening resolutely into the woods to
the north of the lake, they were leaving in the
forest to the south one who would well bear
watching. I do not mean Chip Slider sitting
alone, tired and melancholy, beside the shelter
of poles, wondering if there could possibly be
any place where trouble did not come. No&#8211;not
Chip, but a man who at this moment stood
looking into the little valley where the last
camp of the road builders had been.</p>

<p>A somewhat portly, somewhat pompous and
self-important appearing individual was this
man. His bristly hair, cut very short, was
tinged with gray under the large, loose-fitting
cap such as golfers and motorists wear. His
face was smooth, puffy and red. His very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
eyes, more touched with red, also, than they
should have been, as well as his pudgy hands
indicated self-indulgence and love of ease.</p>

<p>Presently the cap and the person under it
moved from the rise of ground, above the road
builders' last camp, down into the valley. With
a smile that had too much of a sneer about it
to be pleasant, the man ground his heel into
the gravel where the Longknives' road had
come to its troubled ending. With the same
disagreeable sneer in his manner that accompanied
his unpleasant smile, he turned here
and there, noting how the brush and stunted
stalks of mullen were springing up all about
the unfinished task the workmen had left.</p>

<p>Startled suddenly out of his reverie by a
bluejay's scream, or some other noise&#8211;he may
have fancied it, he thought&#8211;the man looked
hastily, searchingly about him; but satisfied,
apparently, that he was alone, he moved leisurely
into a shaded place and sat himself down
on a stump&#8211;another token of the great road
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
that had been begun but never completed. Quite
carefully he drew up his trousers at the knees,
then picked from his hosiery, whose bright color
showed in considerable expanse above his oxfords,
some bits of dry grass and pine needles
gathered in his walk. Mr. Lewis Grandall had
come, apparently, to view the work his perfidy
had caused to be abandoned.</p>

<p>For a long time the unfaithful treasurer of
the ambitious Longknives sat in silent meditation.
He had noted with some satisfaction
that a growth of brush screened his position
from easy discovery should anyone chance to
pass that way; and now his thoughts ran back
over the circumstances leading up to his present
personal situation. Quite steadily his eyes were
fixed upon the unleveled bank of gravel, the
half-hewn logs and all the unfinished work in
the general picture of desolation and abandonment
before him.</p>

<p>It is doubtful, perhaps, if Grandall realized
his own responsibility for the waste and ruin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
on which he looked. At least his face bore no
trace of sorrow, no expression of sincere regret.
The same dull sneer was in his eyes, the same
defiant air was in even the poise of his body and
the heel that, with a certain viciousness, he
dug into the dry earth.</p>

<p>Lewis Grandall's start in life had been attended
by bright prospects. If only he had
been found out the first time he yielded to
temptation in scheming to get money by dishonest
means, he might still have made his
life a success by turning at once to the right
road; but not being detected, he became bolder.
From mere trickery and deceit it is but a step
to out-and-out thievery. Grandall took that
step and more. Yet he managed for long to
cover his tracks sufficiently that few suspected
and no one publicly accused.</p>

<p>One would have supposed that, being accustomed
to the handling of other people's money
in his banking work, he would not easily have
been tempted when he found himself with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
large sum of the Longknives' funds in his
possession. Neither had he any pressing need
of this money at the time he laid his plan to
appropriate to his own use the cash intended
for Nels Anderson's army of road builders. He
merely thought he might some day be glad to
have at his command a secret reserve large
enough to maintain him indefinitely.</p>

<p>So did he plan the pretended robbery by
which a former woodsman he had long known
made off with the suit-case wherein he carried
the money for Anderson's long overdue payroll.
His original purpose had been to make
some sort of division of the cash with Murky;
but there was not anywhere in the Grandall
code either honor or honesty. It was a particularly
bright idea, indeed, so Grandall himself
considered when the thought came to him that
he might have the unsuspecting Murky relieved
of the suit-case before the fellow had so much
as seen what was in it.</p>

<p>The plan was put into effect. Slider, weak
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
of morals, but strong of arm, was chosen for
the work. To him Grandall told as much of
his whole scheme as he thought necessary, but
told him nothing whatever that was wholly
true, with the possible exception of the statement
that Murky was not to be trusted because
he talked too much.</p>

<p>Having been a beneficiary in a small but
largely crooked lumber deal Grandall had once
managed, Slider entered into the robbery
scheme most willingly. With the general result
the reader is familiar; but in detail it may be
added that, in keeping with the promoter's plan,
he who relieved Murky of the suit-case hid it
later just where few would suspect it might be
hidden.</p>

<p>That place was almost within gunshot of the
very spot where the money would have been
distributed had it reached those for whom it
was intended. This not only suited Mr. Grandall's
convenience, but kept Slider in a comparatively
safe locality, as well. So many men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
had been engaged on the work near Opal Lake
that the presence of any kind of person in
working clothes, in that vicinity, would occasion
no remark.</p>

<p>Thus had Slider secreted the suit-case in a
decaying heap of drift along the identical little
stream beside which the great gravel road had
ended. There had Grandall found and quietly
removed the riches the very next day. Then
the dishonest treasurer limped back to his hotel,
for he was supposed to be scarcely able to move,
owing to his "injuries," as a result of the
robbery.</p>

<p>Nearly three years passed. The suit-case lay
undisturbed where Grandall hid it and its
valuable contents were intact. If the Longknives'
treasurer had had occasion to make
use of this money, meanwhile, he had been
either afraid or unwilling to do so. But he
knew where it was. He knew that in an emergency
he could lay hands on a moderate fortune
whose existence he believed none suspected.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
The thought bolstered his courage in scheming
the method of more than one piece of trickery
and dishonesty.</p>

<p>Then came the end, as sooner or later in
crooked plans it must come&#8211;Failure! They all
fail,&#8211;it is inevitable,&#8211;at last. The wrong-doer
faced the necessity of flight.</p>

<p>Grandall's defalcations in the bank did not
appear at once. A small matter&#8211;the "padding"
or falsely increasing of some petty bills
for material furnished the city&#8211;had started
an investigation. It was to the amazement of
everyone who knew the man that a long, long
chain of shady operations and even petty stealing,
even the robbery of his own friends, was
by slow degrees uncovered.</p>

<p>Toward the last, it was apparent, Grandall
had been driven to the most painful desperation.
Night and day he must be on guard to keep
his deceptions covered up. Constantly he must
devise new practices in deceit to conceal others
that once had served, but now, daily and hourly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
were opening at most unexpected points revealing
the treachery, falsehood, hypocrisy and
rottenness they erstwhile had secreted.</p>

<p>Like a common thief, the guilty Grandall
stole away in the night. Behind him he left
all that might have made life useful and pleasant&#8211;home,
friends, hope and ambition. Lying
for some time hidden in a distant city, he
at last felt it safe to travel by a circuitous route
to Opal Lake.</p>

<p>At a country railroad station he stepped
quietly off the train. With no luggage but a
small handbag he slipped into the woods. A
long tramp brought him the following day to
the abandoned clubhouse. The very atmosphere
of oppressive loneliness there pleased him because
of its assurance of his safety from
discovery.</p>

<p>How little Grandall guessed, or even suspected,
that at just this time he could not have
come to a place more fraught with danger to
himself will never be known. No knowledge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
had he of the eyes that stealthily watched him.
No thought had he that the moment he appeared
with the stolen suit-case in hand, ready to slip
away to hoped-for safety in a distant country,
a lurking enemy would leap upon him.</p>

<p>The thief sat for a long time contemplating
the ruins where so abruptly the road building
had ended. It was not until near evening that
he strolled slowly toward the clubhouse. The
general course of the gravel drive he followed,
but in the main kept a few feet to one side,
that the trees and brush might screen him.</p>

<p>He had no fear here, yet he knew some boys
were in camp not far away and not even by
them did he wish to be observed. For he would
spend one night of rest in the clubhouse room
that once had been his own; and then he would
be away&#8211;gone for all time from these and all
the scenes of his younger life.</p>

<p>Yet a pair of heavy, scowling eyes watched
Grandall's every footstep&#8211;saw him enter the
clubhouse&#8211;saw him seat himself restfully in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
the empty living-room beside the great fireplace
and proceed to make a supper of sandwiches
and fruit from his small satchel.</p>

<p>Murky could not have been more vigilant
had his own life been at stake. Not only his
determination to gain again the stolen money
that had been taken from him, but his hatred
of that person the victim of whose double-dealing
he had been, made him watchful, and a very
dangerous man.</p>

<p>Quite suddenly in the afternoon had the
vexed and oft-disappointed tramp discovered
Grandall. It was while the latter stood beside
the ruins where the gravel road had reached
its ending. In delighted surprise Murky with
difficulty suppressed a cry. Dropping instantly
to the ground, he pressed over his mouth
both his dirty hands lest some exclamation
he could scarcely resist should betray him.
"Blame <i>me</i>!" Under his breath he muttered
the words with almost fiendish pleasure.</p>

<p>His worst enemy then was the occasion of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
those sounds that had startled Grandall from
his reverie. But he felt himself so entirely
alone, so wholly free from any probability of
being observed, that he had given the slight
noise not a second thought. During all his
afternoon of sinister gazing upon the ambitious
enterprise his act had wrecked, he still believed
himself as completely alone as a man well could
be in any vast woods or wilderness.</p>

<p>And even when Grandall left the little valley
and walked in silent meditation to spend one
night more&#8211;but one&#8211;in the old house on the
Point he heard no footsteps coming on behind.
His thoughts were far from pleasant ones but
they occupied him fully. The sullen hatred
so clearly shown in the expression of his eyes
and lips was but a reflection of all that passed
within his mind. Friends or foes, men were
all alike to him, and those who had never voiced
a word against him he reviled equally with
those who had been his dupes, and with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
men whose accusations had caused his flight,
as well.</p>

<p>Coming to the clubhouse, Grandall lingered
for a time up and down the weed-grown walk
leading to the garage. Then while it was yet
light he went down to the rotting pier and looked
long and earnestly across and up and down the
lake. Slowly he returned and, entering the
house, went at once down cellar.</p>

<p>In the pitch darkness he felt his way to the
rear of the steps leading from above. Striking
a match or two, he examined by such flickering
flames the rough uneven wall. With bare
hands, then, he seized a projecting corner of
one of the large flat stones and pulled it easily
from place.</p>

<p>If this part of the wall had been laid up
with cement or mortar it had been broken down
some time before, as would appear very probable,
for the masonry that Grandall now brought
tumbling to the floor concealed a deep aperture
in the dry, sandy earth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>The thief's next lighted match revealed the
hole and also revealed a damp and discolored
leather case.</p>

<p>Still crouching in the dark cellar Grandall
managed to work the rusty lock and lay the
suit-case open. Then he struck another match
and its dim glow disclosed the carefully packed
bundles of bills, and among them a bag of coin.
He nodded his head in a satisfied way. He had
assured himself on first arriving at the old
house that the treasure was safe; but he would
not remove it from the hiding place until he was
prepared to leave, he had decided. Now he was
ready.</p>

<p>And where was Murky?</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, from his concealment
among the bushes near by, he was trying to
decipher the room upstairs that this lone visitor
to the old house would probably occupy. He
had lost sight of Grandall when the latter had
quickly entered and gone to the cellar. But
it was only for a little while that the scowling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
eyes searched the open door and the windows
in vain.</p>

<p>As Grandall came up to the living-room carrying
the discolored suit-case, he glanced quickly
all about him. Possibly some sense of his guilt
came to his mind now that the evidence of his
theft was squarely in his hands, and for the
first time he appeared apprehensive. Yet he
paused only for a few seconds. He saw to it
that all the first floor doors were bolted from
within, and slowly climbed the stairs to the
sleeping rooms above.</p>

<p>As if quite at home the man entered that
room whose long, low window opened upon
the little balcony toward the lake. He smoothed
down the mattress and brought a blanket from
an adjoining chamber. Opening the window
wide, for these upper rooms were very close
and warm, he drew the suit-case to the better
light he thus admitted and proceeded to count
the money it contained.</p>

<p>The night was hot, the air seemed stifling,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
but when he had satisfied himself as to the
amount of the treasure, Grandall returned the
packages of bills and the bag of gold and silver
pieces to their places, then closed and locked the
window. He locked his chamber door also,
before lying down to sleep. As if that could
save him now!</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>DAVE MACLESTER'S ADVENTURE</span></h2>

<p>It required no little courage for Dave MacLester
to row across the dark waters of the
lake to the darker woods of the north shore.
Had there been someone to go with him he would
have answered the cries for aid much more willingly.
But since either he or Chip must remain
in camp, Davy set out alone, pretty gloomily,
pulling the heavy scow with what speed he
could.</p>

<p>MacLester was far from being a coward but
by nature he was more timid than calm, self-possessed
Phil Way, or bold and venturesome
Paul Jones. With a keen sense of duty and
resolute determination to overcome every
thought of fear, however, he ran the scow
against the steep bank of the lake's far shore.</p>

<p>The voice that had guided Dave across the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
water greeted him at once. "It's full glad I
am to see ye, even if I can't see ye half in the
darkness of it," came with a pronounced Irish
accent.</p>

<p>"Guess that won't make much difference if
you can see your way into the boat," Dave
answered. "Did you get lost?"</p>

<p>"No, no! not lost at all, at all, but I couldn't
find me way, quite," came the response. The
speaker had now come down on the sloping
bank close to the boat, as if about to step
aboard.</p>

<p>"I only wondered," Dave answered. "Seems
as if the woods were full of mysterious people&#8211;one
lone man hiding in an old clubhouse,
another&#8211;" The lad checked himself. A sudden
thought came to him that perhaps he better
not speak too freely without knowing with whom
he was talking.</p>

<p>"What's he doin' there? A man all alone,
and in an old clubhouse? What might be his
name thin?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>"How should I know?" Dave answered to
this question. He was becoming the least bit
suspicious and again he checked himself when
it was just at his tongue's tip to add, "We think
the name may be Grandall." There would be no
harm in awaiting developments before he told
a stranger quite all he knew, he grimly reflected&#8211;a
wise thought, it should be needless to say.</p>

<p>"No harm,&#8211;no harm intinded," spoke the
Irishman good-naturedly. He had come close
to the water's edge now and Dave's eyes being
fairly accustomed to the darkness, made him out
to be a little, elderly man with a short beard,
but very little hair on his head. The old fellow's
baldness was, indeed, the most noticeable
thing about him as, with hat in hand, lest it fall
off into the lake, perhaps, he stooped down the
more closely to inspect MacLester and the boat.</p>

<p>"Why," said the boy, fearing his short
"How should I know?" might have been unpleasantly
curt, "You see there are four of
us fellows in camp on t'other side and we've
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
happened to see a man at the old house on the
Point below us. We've wondered who he might
be, staying alone as he does, and keeping so
out of sight of everybody. It's miles to the
nearest house and nobody but our crowd of
four fellows and our one visitor is anywhere
near. But climb down into the scow and I'll
take you over. Steady now, while I hold the
old shell up to the bank."</p>

<p>For a few seconds the stranger made no reply.
Then&#8211;"It must be a lake here thin. Has
it a name, at all, d'ye know?"</p>

<p>"Why, sure it's a lake!" replied Dave a little
tartly, wondering if the old fellow supposed
the sheet of water lying so quiet in the darkness
there might be a river or an ocean. "Its
name is Opal Lake. This old boat is good and
strong though. It'll carry us across all right."</p>

<p>Once again there was a long pause before the
stranger spoke. "Oh yis!" he suddenly exclaimed,
"There's me baggage, and me almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
forgettin' of it! Will ye help me a wee bit with
it? Sure 'tis not far!"</p>

<p>The kindly and somewhat coaxing voice of the
old fellow, whose brogue was just enough to
give a pleasant quaintness to his speech, amused
MacLester and he assented readily enough to
the request made of him. He threw a loop of
the scow's anchor rope over a stub projecting
from the water and sprang ashore. He did not
notice in the darkness that his leap broke the
fragile branch securing the boat, allowing her
to drift, but at once said:</p>

<p>"We'll have to wiggle some, for they'll be
looking for me in camp pretty shortly."</p>

<p>"Sure, 'tis not far," the man again said
pleasantly, and clapping his straw hat down
over his head till it almost concealed his ears,
he led the way into the woods.</p>

<p>"Me name is Smith&#8211;Jawn Smith. What's
your'n thin?" spoke the genial Irishman, as
the two walked quite rapidly, despite the
darkness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>"MacLester&#8211;I'm Scotch," said Dave, smiling
to himself over the thought that his new
friend plainly was not French.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith made no reply and a long distance
had been covered when Dave spoke again.</p>

<p>"How far back are you&#8211;that is, your baggage?
We'll never find the lake again, till
morning, if we don't watch out."</p>

<p>"Sure, 'tis not far now any more," came
the quite unsatisfactory answer. "Is it tired
ye air?"</p>

<p>"No&#8211;but&#8211;great guns!"</p>

<p>With no other remark Dave continued close
behind or alongside his guide for a long time&#8211;a
very long time, it seemed to him,&#8211;possibly
a quarter hour. Then&#8211;</p>

<p>"Where in the world are we bound for?" he
asked pretty sharply.</p>

<p>"Sure, ye'll not lave me," was the answer,
quite pleadingly.</p>

<p>With a decided mixture of feelings Dave said,
"Couldn't you do without your baggage until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
morning?" But in his thoughts he added:
"I've heard of wild Irishmen, and I guess I've
met one, too." Still, he smiled in a grim way,
reflecting further that he, also, would have a
stirring personal adventure to report in camp,
and he would see it through now at all hazards.</p>

<p>MacLester was certainly right. He would
have a story of personal adventure to relate
when he parted company with "Jawn Smith."
But this was something he was not to succeed
in doing so soon as he supposed.</p>

<p>Time passed and still the little, old fellow
with now and again his oft-repeated, "'Tis not
far," trudged onward. He <i>seemed</i> to know the
way perfectly. Dave followed or kept near his
side. However, when for possibly the tenth
time the man said, "'Tis not far," the lad's impatience
got the better of him.</p>

<p>"Your ideas of distance must have been
picked up in an automobile," he said. "Twenty
miles isn't far in a car, maybe. One or two&#8211;not
to mention five or six&#8211;may be a lot better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
than a fair stretch for walking. And I've been
gone a long time from camp."</p>

<p>The stranger made no reply.</p>

<p>"What are you doing in the woods&#8211;fishing,
or just traveling for your health?" Dave was
getting more than a little cross and his tone
showed it.</p>

<p>"Sure, thin', I was goin' to tell ye," muttered
Mr. Smith, still going forward but more slowly
now,&#8211;"I was goin' to tell ye that me business is
that of a sivy-ear&#8211;you know?"</p>

<p>"A what? I'm afraid I don't know exactly."</p>

<p>"You don't know a sivy-ear? Sure! Peekin'
through a little popgun on three poles? That's
a sivy-ear."</p>

<p>"Oh, a surveyor!" exclaimed Dave. "What
in the world have you been surveying here in
the woods?"</p>

<p>"Down't be axin' questions. Sivy-ears go
peekin' an' peekin' an' they don't tell whatever
they may see. For why should there be sivy-ears
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
at all, if they towld what they do be
seein'?"</p>

<p>MacLester was both irritated and amused;
but he was getting too uneasy now to let the all-too-apparent
humbuggery of his companion go
unchallenged.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll say this much, Mr. Smith, that if
you know where your instruments are, and can
go there right off, I'll stand by my bargain to
help you; but if you don't, you better say so.
We're five miles from the lake now, if we're
a foot."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's right ye air," was the still unsatisfactory
answer. And though Dave replied more
sharply than he had yet spoken, his companion
each time responded in soft tones and mild
language, but always evasively.</p>

<p>"Well! if you know where we are, tell me
that!" spoke MacLester very firmly at last.
"I'm going not a step further until I know what
sort of a wild goose business you are taking me
on!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>"Oh,&#8211;oh! Sorra day&#8211;sorra day!" The
man sat himself down heavily upon a fallen tree
over whose prostrate trunk he had just escaped
falling. "Ye must do as ye will, but it's lost I
fear I am."</p>

<p>"Lost?" echoed Dave loudly. "You don't
mean that we've been jamming ahead in the
dark, and all this distance, without knowing
where we were going!"</p>

<p>"It was <i>not far</i>!" Mr. Smith moaned wearily.
"Oh! it is tired am I!"</p>

<p>"Well! I'll be cow-kicked!"</p>

<p>And possibly David MacLester may be excused
for using so impolite an expression when
his situation is considered. Here he was miles
from Opal Lake&#8211;miles from camp, and lost in
the woods in the dead of night with a strange
man who might be either a dangerous crook or
a harmless lunatic&#8211;circumstances pointed toward
both.</p>

<p>"Ye'll not be blamin' <i>me</i>, sure!" spoke the
old fellow. His very voice showed that he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
indeed tired to the verge of fainting; but his
manner was as mild and child-like as his words.</p>

<p>Language could not express Dave's feelings.
In mute contempt, anger, weariness and a certain
deep curiosity mingled, he dropped to the
ground.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't blame you, mister," said the boy
at last, "but I set out to do you a friendly turn
and you get me into this pickle as a result and
still give me no satisfaction as to where you belong
or where you want to get to."</p>

<p>"Jawn Smith"&#8211;and it plainly was not his
name&#8211;made no answer for a long time. Meanwhile
David expressed himself pretty freely to
the effect that there was but one course to pursue
and that was to stay right where they were
until morning. "And when daylight comes
we'll head straight for the lake," said he.</p>

<p>"It's no odds who I be," said the stranger
finally. "If I be not a real sivy-ear, I'm the
likes of one, a peekin' and peekin'. Which is
for why I can't be gossipin' about matters that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
means a great deal to them that I would be
befriendin'. Come mornin', we'll see."</p>

<p>"Humph! Hope we may see more than we
do this minute," Dave answered. For although
the two had been so long in the darkness that
they could make out trees and other objects
well enough to avoid them, it had been a very
hard as well as a long tramp and the more so
because of the gloom of night.</p>

<p>His head pillowed on his arm Dave fell asleep,
at last, regardless of the many things that vexed
and worried him. His queer companion slept
also and so did the daylight find them sore and
hungry. The sun's rays brightened their
spirits, but "you can't eat sunbeams," as MacLester
rather gloomily remarked. The first excitement
of the adventure had subsided now and
he was quite inclined to despondency.</p>

<p>On the strength of the stranger's statement
that his camp and baggage and food he carried
could be found in a short time Dave again let
him lead the way. A long walk in one direction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
was followed by a tramp of a still greater distance
in another with no apparent intention of
arriving anywhere.</p>

<p>And both MacLester and the stranger were
suffering for water. They had crossed a small
stream where there were still pools of good
water, notwithstanding the severe drouth, early
in the morning. It was decided to revisit it before
starting for the lake. But here, too, long-continued
efforts were a flat failure.</p>

<p>It is a dreadful feeling to realize that you
know not which way to turn to reach any given
point. Lost! It is a word whose terrors must
be experienced to be fully understood.</p>

<p>"Come, now! I'll be the guide, and just you
keep with me. We'll get out of here somehow,"
said MacLester resolutely. Thus far the
stranger, for the most part, had been the pilot.
It was past noon. Neither had tasted food since
the preceding day and both were parched for
water. The sun beat down till even through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
thick screen of pine and deciduous branches the
heat was trying. No bit of breeze relieved the
sultriness.</p>

<p>But Dave's best efforts seemed fruitless. The
only reward in a long, long tramp was to lead
the weary pair to a small stream. But even
this was a most fortunate discovery and both
drank freely, then drank again.</p>

<p>As they rested the stranger was much depressed.
After a long silence he said in hopeless
tones: "What for a man ye may think me,
I dunno; but the saints bear me witness, me bye,
never did I sit out to drag ye where ye be. It's
all past goin' further I am, and ye've got to
lave me. An' if ever at last ye come to that
lake, go right at wanst to that clubhouse and tell
the gintleman who's stoppin' there, for the love
of hivin' to come quickly where I be. It's
Daddy O'Lear that wants him, say&#8211;poor&#8211;poor
Daddy O'Lear."</p>

<p>"What's that?" exclaimed MacLester. "Now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
if this <i>ain't</i> a pretty mess! I was sure your
name wasn't Smith, but&#8213;"</p>

<p>"An' I'll be staying thin, till ye come fer me;
but ye'll be tellin' nobody but the wan man that
I'm here, be sure."</p>

<p>"You are going along with me," was the decisive
answer. "Then I'll tell no one anything.
I don't want anything to do with your friend.
There's a way out of this howling wilderness
somehow! We've got to move! It will be dark
again in two hours!"</p>

<p>But even a strong tugging at his arm would
not persuade Mr. O'Lear, if such were his real
name, to rise and start.</p>

<p>"You go with me or you'll go to jail where
someone else ought to be too, if I'm not mistaken,"
said Dave with emphasis. "You can't
stay here, man! And whoever you are, I'm not
going to let you!"</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>"THE LAKE! IT'S THE ONLY CHANCE OF ESCAPE!"</span></h2>

<p>The sun went down and the coming darkness
warned the three boys, vainly searching for
Dave MacLester, that they must hurry if they
were to find their way to camp. If no success
had attended them by daylight, they certainly
could hope to do nothing after nightfall, and
they turned back toward the lake.</p>

<p>All afternoon Phil, Billy and Paul had
tramped the woods. Except for the three
tracks in some soft earth, as earlier mentioned,
not one certain clue to the direction taken by
Dave and his unknown companion had the
friends found.</p>

<p>Quite worn out in both body and mind, they
took careful note of their bearings, then headed
by what they thought a bee-line for Opal Lake.
On and on they hurried. The twilight deepened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
and they kept to a direct course with difficulty.
And still they reached neither the lake nor any
familiar spot.</p>

<p>"Fine boat we're in if we've gone and got
lost," gasped Paul, bringing up the rear. The
boys were pushing forward at a slow run, Phil
Way in the lead.</p>

<p>"We didn't pay close enough attention to the
distance, when we were going the other way;
but we'll be out of this in a little while now,"
came Way's hopeful answer.</p>

<p>"I smell smoke. It might be from our own
camp. Chip would be firing up like mad to
make a bright blaze," came Billy's voice above
the steady patter of feet upon the needle-strewn
ground.</p>

<p>"There's some breeze picking up, but not
quite from that direction," said Phil, though
he paused not a moment.</p>

<p>Paul was first to discover that the course Way
was taking could not be right. "I can catch the
smell of the swampy ground, at the west end of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
the lake, in the wind," he said. "We've got to
head right against this breeze."</p>

<p>A brief pause, and the lads agreed that Paul
was right. And soon the proof was positive.
Ten minutes of rapid walking brought the
chums to the water, but it was at the east end of
the lake, not the north shore, at which they
found themselves. Another half mile or less
would have taken them entirely beyond the
familiar sheet of water, and have led them,
hopelessly lost, undoubtedly into the woods to
the south. Their course had been steered too
far easterly in the beginning.</p>

<p>Glad, indeed, to be so near their camp once
more, despite the weight upon their hearts concerning
Dave, the boys agreed to continue on
around the upper end of the lake on foot rather
than return now for the skiff on the more distant
shore. So did they come presently to their
shack and the bright blaze Chip Slider had
burning as a beacon light for them.</p>

<p>The ray of hope the young searchers held out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
to one another on their homeward way, that
they might find MacLester safe and sound in
camp upon their own arrival there, was quickly
turned to disappointment. Chip had no news&#8211;not
one word of information, good or bad, to
report. He had remained faithfully in camp
and had seen nothing, heard nothing unusual.</p>

<p>"Exceptin'," said he, "there's bad fires
somewheres in the woods. I smelled smoke the
minute the wind began blowin'. All day there
wasn't hide nor hair of air a stirrin'. It was
just after sundown that it started in, real
gentle, an' it's gettin' higher. You take a fire
in the woods, and a stiff gale, and you've got
something to look out for, I tell you."</p>

<p>"We've got to rest and think a little, and
have something to eat," said Phil, paying scant
attention to Slider's words. "We've done what
we can in one direction, now we must start out
on some other plan."</p>

<p>"I knowed you'd be hungry and I've got the
coffee hot. I boiled some eggs and cooled 'em
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
this afternoon and them are ready, too. Just
you all rest and I'll get some kind of supper,"
announced Slider, almost bashfully. But his
friends were truly glad to do as he suggested.
The simple, hasty meal of cold, hard-boiled eggs
with plenty of bread and butter, crackers and
cheese and coffee would have been most enjoyable
too, had there been no absent one.</p>

<p>For an hour or two the three Auto Boys
rested and sought to find the best plan to pursue
toward finding Dave MacLester. They could
not do better, they at last felt sure, than to report
their mystery to the authorities at Staretta.</p>

<p>From the town, also, inquiries among the
villages lying beyond the great woods could be
made by telegraph or, even better, by telephone,
perhaps. If Dave had been foully dealt with,
as seemed only too probable, the law's officials
could not be any too quickly informed.</p>

<p>It was drawing on toward midnight when the
Thirty's lamps were lighted, the engine started
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
and all made ready for a rapid run to the town.
Phil took the wheel. Telling Slider to keep a
bright blaze shining and his ears wide open for
any signal from over the lake, he threw in the
gear, let the clutch take hold, and the three boys
began this last bit of service they were ever to
have from their much beloved car.</p>

<p>Way was usually a conservative driver but
tonight his foot at no time ceased to press the
pedal that increased the gas. Over the smooth
spots and over the rough ones, ruts, roots and
hummocks of the hard-baked earth, the automobile
whirred. Rarely did the speedometer
show less than fifteen miles and often the indicator
touched twenty-five, and this while the
road was still but the woodland trail.</p>

<p>Luckily the lights were clear and bright, but
more fortunate still, Phil was every moment
alert and earnestly attentive to every inch of
the road and every throb of the machine.</p>

<p>Like some swift phantom the blaze of the
lamps sped on and on among the ever retreating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
shadows and utter blackness of the night. Like
black-hooded spectres the trees at either side
seemed to glide ever to the rear, silent and
ghostly except as their branches were tossed
by the rising wind.</p>

<p>It was not until they were far past the bleak,
dark house of Nels Anderson, that Billy
shouted his opinion that inquiry should have
been made there. No, Phil called with emphasis,
the time for giving heed to uncertain, unknown
persons had passed. He was sorry the arrest
of Murky and of Grandall had not been brought
about when first it was suggested, he said. A
lot of things might have turned out differently
if it had been done, and he, at least, believed&#8213;</p>

<p>"Look! There's sure fire yonder!" It was
Paul's voice interrupting.</p>

<p>The car was fairly clear of the woods and the
road now led among the blackened stumps and
rough undergrowth of the district where flames
had raged in time long past.</p>

<p>Far to the west and north the sky was blazing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
red. The whole distant horizon of the direction
named seemed as if the doors of some mighty,
seething furnace, miles in width, stood open. A
rank odor of burning wood came stronger and
stronger on the gusts of wind.</p>

<p>"It's a good ways off and maybe isn't burning
much this way," shouted Worth above the
rush of air and whir of the auto's wheels.</p>

<p>"The wind, man! It's sweeping right into
the heart of the woods," Phil answered loudly.
But not for a moment did the car slacken speed.
The road was getting better. Staretta was but
five miles distant.</p>

<p>"Still, there's not much danger of the fire
coming our way. It will go way north of the
lake," Worth replied.</p>

<p>"And that's just the direction Mac's in,"
echoed Paul Jones in tones of alarm.</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>Phil cut the word quick and short. His tone
and the instantly still greater speed of the car
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
told all too plainly where his fears were
running.</p>

<p>There was no need to rouse Link Fraley or
the officers of Staretta. They were astir watching
the progress of the distant flames. Scores
of men had already gone to join the fire fighters,
who, it was reported, had reached the scene
from Jacques' Mills, a settlement to the northwest
that lay in great danger, should the wind
change.</p>

<p>The fire had been noticed only as clouds of
smoke during the day, Link Fraley said. In
the afternoon messengers arrived saying that
the blaze was gaining great headway. It might
yet be confined to a certain swampy district,
thick with dead trees and grass and a rank undergrowth
of rushes, now dry as tinder from
the long drouth. It was here the fire had
started. Many men returned with the bearer
of the news to aid in the battle.</p>

<p>With sundown came the wind. There could
be no stopping of the terrible destruction so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
long as the gale increased, Link Fraley stated.
The best that any could hope for was that the
blaze could be kept within a narrow limit as it
swept onward into the wholly unsettled country
so saving the little towns and mills along
the railroad line.</p>

<p>But about MacLester&#8211;the hearts of the three
boys sank like lead. Even Sheriff Larsen said
nothing could be done for him while so great a
number of lives were in jeopardy and every
hand was needed to preserve them. He was
sorry&#8211;very sorry; but he believed and hoped
Dave would escape in safety, somehow, though
there was not a thing that anyone could do at
once to help him or to aid his friends in finding
him.</p>

<p>Perhaps he had been lured into the woods for
purposes of robbery, or by Murky, in a spirit
of revenge; but even the much-needed attention
of the law to that dangerous character must
wait, the sheriff said, until the great fire could
in some degree be overcome.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>Awed and alarmed, their every nerve tense
with a depth of interest and anxiety such as few
ever experience, the three friends listened to
the conversation of those about them. The
principal crowd had gathered before Fraley's
store. Suddenly, from the partially lighted interior,
Link Fraley came. With a nod of his
head he beckoned the Auto Boys aside.</p>

<p>"An Indian fellow&#8211;Doughnut Dan, they call
him&#8211;has just come in from up the line," said
he, "and brings word that the fire will get south
of Opal Lake and no stoppin' it. Hadn't ye
better go? Right now you'll be ahead of it to
the lake and no danger. Later on&#8211;and ye've
got that Slider chap on your hands back at your
camp. Get him and get your stuff, and get 'em
quick."</p>

<p>"But MacLester! We can't&#8213;" began
Way hurriedly.</p>

<p>"You've <i>got</i> to! What can't be helped, can't
be helped, but what <i>can</i> be&#8211;that's what you got
to think about and <i>right off</i>!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>"He's dead right, Phil, bad as it is," murmured
Billy sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"It may be, but we'll&#8213;"</p>

<p>Whatever Way had meant to say, he spoke no
further but quickly started for the car. Paul
and Billy followed and the latter took the wheel
while Phil re-lighted the gas lamps and Jones
gave the crank a quick, quarter turn.</p>

<p>When but little north of Staretta the three
boys could see that all the Indian had reported
was true, and more than true. If the high wind
continued the whole district south of Opal Lake
would be swept by the fire within the next few
hours.</p>

<p>But even in this estimate they were falling
far short of the truth. Every hour the wind
blew harder. Great brands of fire were being
carried forward, starting constantly, and in
hundreds of places, fresh bursts of flame.</p>

<p>The car never traveled better than on this
last night of its usefulness. In but little more
than twenty minutes the boys were driving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
through dense volumes of almost stifling smoke.
They were now well into the woods and within
the path of the flames' fiercely rapid advance.</p>

<p>As they went forward they discovered that
the fire's main path would probably be midway
between the lake and the desolate country
burned over years before. But it would be
spreading constantly. Nothing could check it.</p>

<p>Suddenly a feeble glimmer of light loomed
out of the smoke and the darkness forward. It
was the glow of the lamps at Nels Anderson's.</p>

<p>"They'll never get out alive," called Phil.
"Hold up, Billy!"</p>

<p>By the lights of the car, and from the windows
and open door of the low, unpainted
house, the figures of Anderson and another
man, and of Mrs. Anderson and their little girl
could be seen moving hurriedly in and out.
Phil sprang down to investigate.</p>

<p>The giant Swede, his family and their guest
were carrying the household goods of every
kind to the very center of the small clearing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
What they feared was all too plain. But would
their efforts count for anything? Would their
very lives be safe in this small space?</p>

<p>"I tank she will go nort of us," spoke Anderson,
excitedly, as Phil approached. "She must
bane most at da lake now."</p>

<p>Obviously he referred to the fire. Before
Phil could say more than that he hoped the little
clearing would escape the fire's main fury, at
least, the other man came up. He was the person
in the golfing cap. Way was sure of his
identity instantly and his face grew hard.</p>

<p>"Have you been in town? How bad is this
situation?" he asked calmly but with a thoroughly
business air.</p>

<p>"Ever so bad. You'll never be safe here,"
the boy answered with some excitement. "You
better&#8213;"</p>

<p>"No! the worst of it will be north of us,"
said the other quickly. "It came up as if the
whole woods had caught fire at once. We
smelled and saw the smoke in the afternoon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
Nels and I were 'way west of here to see what
the danger was. We'd have been all right in
this part but for the wind. But you boys&#8211;are
any of your party at the lake now? Because&#8211;you'll
have to move fast! Get back here to this
clearing. If the fire keeps tending north you'll
be far safer here than on the water. There's
no telling how long it might keep you hemmed in
there."</p>

<p>Much disturbed by the thought that even now
Chip Slider might be in gravest danger, Phil
said hastily, "Thank you for all you say, at
least," and hurried to the car.</p>

<p>"The worst of this is ahead of us! Get to
the lake, Billy, quick!"</p>

<p>Again the trusted Thirty shot forward. The
fire was still too distant to be clearly seen
among the trees, but the sky reflecting its red
fury sent down a glow which, but for the dense
smoke, would have been like early twilight.
Still over ruts and roots, smooth spots and
rough spots alike, Billy drove, not carelessly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
but very fast. Still the smoke-filled air grew
denser.</p>

<p>"The man is crazy! The fire may reach the
lake, but Anderson's place will be squarely in
the path of the worst of it," cried Phil Way
excitedly. The boys were nearing their camp
now, and the duller glow upon the sky gave
proof that the flames were more distant from
here.</p>

<p>Poor Slider was found nearly beside himself
with fear for the safety not of himself but his
new-found friends. He was resolutely at his
post, and the blazing campfire showed that he
had not forgotten to keep going a signal to Dave
MacLester that the camp was not deserted,
should he chance to appear on the farther
shore.</p>

<p>"We're the veriest blockheads!" said Phil
Way, as he looked over the lake and noted that
here was the only place of real safety. "We've
left the Andersons to be suffocated if they aren't
burned up. Who'll go with me to bring 'em?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>"I'll go! Come on!" cried Paul, and Billy
was not a second behind him.</p>

<p>"Wait!" Phil ordered. Then, "One of you
stay here with Chip. Add all the logs you can
to the raft. Make it bigger, stronger! There'll
be eight of us, likely, that it will have to carry."</p>

<p>"Gee whiz! The car! The car, Phil! It'll be
burned."</p>

<p>"No, it won't! Into the lake it goes. Water
won't put it out of business permanently.
Billy, will you stay?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead!" cried Worth and in five seconds
Phil was driving the automobile in a way he
had never done before.</p>

<p>Even before Anderson's place was reached the
raging flames to the west of the road lit up the
narrow trail with a frightful glare. But on and
on the car flew.</p>

<p>The little clearing was reached in the nick of
time. Great sparks and even flaming branches
were raining down upon it. The smoke was
stifling.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>Huddled under some kind of an old canvas,&#8211;a
tent cloth from some workman's camp on the
gravel road, perhaps, Mrs. Anderson and the
little girl were trying to escape the smoke and
terrific heat. The grass all about the clearing
was on fire. The little house must go, when the
main body of the flames came closer, and very
doubtful did it look that life itself could be
saved in so exposed a place.</p>

<p>With a cry, "You can never come through
the fire if you stay here, people! We've come
for you in the car! The lake! It's the only
chance of escape!" Phil made his presence
known.</p>

<p>The roar and crackle and all the dreadful
noise of the ocean of flame that, as far as eye
could see, flooded the woods to the west seemed
quite to drown the boy's loud shout.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE LAST RUN OF THE BELOVED THIRTY</span></h2>

<p>A second time Phil loudly called and now an
answer showed Nels Anderson and the golfing
man to be near the edge of the woods. They had
completed the burning of a wide strip of the dry
grass completely around the clearing, only to
find their work useless. All hope of thus
stopping the spread of the fire toward the buildings
was destroyed by the falling embers. The
wind carried them everywhere.</p>

<p>There was no time to lose. The danger of
death from suffocation, even if the flames could
be escaped, was very great. Now the roof of
the house was on fire. There was not a barrel
of water within miles. Further fighting, further
loss of time, would be folly. Giants of the forest
were flaming up from roots to topmost
branch not twenty yards within the woods. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
whole roadway would be ablaze, on both sides,
in a few minutes.</p>

<p>A most pitiable object was Anderson's poor
cow. Her head to the ground as if to escape
the smoke, a low, frightened bellowing told of
her realization of the danger. Forgetful of
herself the child was saying, "Oh, poor, good
bossy! Oh, poor bossy!"</p>

<p>The small haystack along side the crude, log
barn suddenly blazed up. The dull red glow
gave place to a white light all through the clearing.
It was impossible now that any part of
the property could be saved. Anderson and
the other man came running to the car.</p>

<p>"It will be a close shave! Can you make it,
boys?" cried the one in the golf cap, above the
roar of the flames.</p>

<p>"You bet! Be at the lake in no time! We've
often carried more'n six," yelled Paul excitedly.
"Right in here!" and he held the tonneau door
open wide. "You in front with Phil, Mr.
Anderson!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>Even as Jones followed Mrs. Anderson, the
little girl and the golfing man into the tonneau,
and slammed the door behind him, the Thirty
was under way. Its staunch gears were never
before so quickly shifted from low to high.
What mattered it if Paul did sit down hard in
the strange man's lap? What mattered it if poor
Nels, unused to automobiles, was jerked nearly
from his seat before he got his great, clumsy
legs quite inside? The raging sea of fire was
bordering the trail ahead, and hundreds of
little tongues of flames leaped here and there
in the parched, dry grass and weeds in the road
itself.</p>

<p>With frightened, staring eyes Paul looked
with wonder upon the dreadful flames leaping
from one treetop to another. The man beside
him was shielding his face from the terrible
glare and heat and the woman and little girl
clung tightly to each other, the former watching
only the child and holding a hand to protect her
face. As if dazed and unable to comprehend,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
Nels Anderson looked always back toward the
doomed clearing.</p>

<p>Phil Way alone watched the road ahead.
With firm set jaw and straining eyes he looked
ever forward through the blinding glare and
the billows of smoke that now and again concealed
the trail completely. But his hands
gripped the wheel with perfect confidence, his
foot pressed the accelerator steadily. The gallant
car responded. The ground seemed speeding
from under its wheels. On and on it flew.</p>

<p>Thus far the fire had raged to the west of
the road only. In but a few places had it reached
the trees directly beside the trail, pausing there
till some fresh gust of wind, or shower of sparks,
carried it to the other side.</p>

<p>But now Phil saw before him a spot where
on both sides of the road the forest was a flaming
furnace. He did not falter. On flew the
car. Another moment and it was in the midst
of the fire. A hundred yards it ran through
the deadly heat, the awful roar and sheets of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
flame leaping upward and outward till their
fiery fingers were all but seizing the brave lad
and his passengers.</p>

<p>Safely the Thirty ran the fearful gauntlet.
There came a shout of praise and admiration
from the golfing man, words of thanksgiving
from the woman. The worst was over.</p>

<p>Rapidly, but not so fast as in the direct course
of the wind, the fire was reaching out toward
Opal Lake. Like a galloping army it came on
behind the car, but, barring accident, could
never, would never, overtake the swift machine.</p>

<p>Barring accident! Bravely the engine, clutch,
gears, springs, axles and wheels had withstood
the strain of the terrific speed, the heavy load
and the wretched road. Bravely, with every
charge of gas, each cylinder delivered generous
power.</p>

<p>The car shot down the grade into the small
valley where, some distance below, the gravel
road came to its abrupt ending. There was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
heavy jolt as the front wheels struck the dry
bed of the shallow stream.</p>

<p>Anderson, the giant, pitched forward. He
might have caught and righted himself quite
readily had he had complete use of his hands
and arms, long since partially paralyzed; but
in his disabled condition he missed the windshield
frame he tried to catch, and went partly
overboard.</p>

<p>With his left hand Phil Way reached for his
falling passenger, still holding the wheel with
his right. He seized poor Anderson just in
time, but the great bulk of the fellow drew
him partly from his own seat, and pulled the
steering wheel sharply round.</p>

<p>Still going at speed, though now on the upward
grade, the automobile answered instantly
to the call of the steering knuckles&#8211;true to its
mechanism, perfectly, to the last&#8211;answered to
the driver's unintended command, and sharply
swerved to the right. A large pine stood in
its course.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>So quickly did the collision occur, so unprepared
were any of the automobile's occupants
to meet the terrible shock that the escape
of all from serious injury was truly miraculous.
The outcome must surely have been far worse
had the tree been struck squarely head-on. The
fact of the fender and right front tire and wheel
receiving the heaviest force of the impact lessened
the jar, and the car swung around spending
broken momentum in the dishing of both
rear wheels.</p>

<p>Nels Anderson, pitched far out on the ground,
was gathered up cut and bleeding. Mrs. Anderson
and the child were bruised but not much
hurt. Phil, Paul and the golfing man suffered
no injuries beyond the nervous shock.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, Paul Jones spoke
not a word. Questioningly he looked at Way.</p>

<p>Phil had been first to help Anderson to his
feet. Now leaving him to the care of the others
he quickly inspected the damage done to the
machine. The roar of the flames was still just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
behind. Their blood-red glare cast a twilight
glow far ahead through the darkness of the
woods.</p>

<p>"She was a mighty good car," said Phil Way,
softly, as if to himself, quite as one might speak
of some friend who has gone. "A mighty good
car!" but at the same moment his gaze took
in the flames fast following along the ground
and from tree to tree both west and south.
Even here the heat and smoke were terrible.
The dull red light was everywhere. The very
sky seemed ablaze.</p>

<p>"This is most unfortunate. I'm truly sorry
for this, boys," spoke the golfing man, very
soberly. He too had been hastily investigating
the damage.</p>

<p>Though his voice was kind, the speaker irritated
Paul Jones exceedingly. "Wouldn't have
happened but for you, and except to send you
to prison you aren't worth it, I can tell you
that, Mr. Grandall," were the words he thought,
but did not utter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>"Might have been worse! We're still a mile
from the lake and the fire's just behind us!
That's the whole answer," said Phil rapidly.
His words were in reply to the stranger's sympathetic
expression, but were equally addressed
to all. "Right ahead on this trail, then! We've
a raft that will hold everyone!"</p>

<p>Rapid movement was necessary. The wind
was blowing furiously now. No power on earth
could stay the flames that swept ever forward.
Their path grew constantly wider.</p>

<p>Both Phil and Paul looked with astonishment
to see the stranger, whom they now detested
more than ever, seize Anderson's little girl in
his arms to carry her; but they were all hastening
forward through the crimson light, and
clouds of smoke. No more than a glance could
the boys exchange.</p>

<p>Many times the two lads looked back. It was
fortunate, perhaps, that the rise of the ground
soon shut off their view of the prized Thirty.
The hungry, sweeping flames came curling, playing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
leaping, dancing, roaring on. They reached
the car.</p>

<p>Phil remembered, long afterward, that as
he stepped out of the automobile for the last
time he noticed the speedometer, twisted about
so that the light of a lamp shattered and broken,
but still burning, fell upon it. The reading was
5,599 miles&#8211;the record of the season.</p>

<p>Safely ahead of the fire the fleeing refugees
reached Opal Lake. With a glad shout, though
their faces showed deepest anxiety and fear,
Billy Worth and Chip Slider received them.</p>

<p>"The raft's all ready! I've made it big
enough to float a house! All our provisions are
on board, too!" said Billy to Phil, the moment
he ran up. "Where's the car?"</p>

<p>A few words told the story. There was no
comment beyond the quick, "Oh! what an
escape!"</p>

<p>The snaky tongues of fire coming on swift,
almost, as the wind itself, were but two hundred
yards away when the rescuers and rescued embarked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
upon the raft. Boxes and camp equipage
afforded seats. Billy had trimmed a
couple of extra long poles with which to move
the clumsy craft, and present safety for all was
assured.</p>

<p>The dawn was just breaking. Once out on
the water the coming daylight was quite clear
despite the smoke that in vast clouds rolled
swiftly over, whipped and torn by the wind.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness there's no fire to the north&#8211;not
yet anyway," said Phil rubbing his face,
grimy with smoke and ashes. He was thinking
of MacLester and for the information of the
Andersons briefly told of Dave's unaccountable
disappearance.</p>

<p>"There's a long stretch of pine on the other
side," said the stranger, still wearing his golfing
cap, by the way. "There are a couple of
streams there, though, both of them flowing
into the lower end of the lake. If your friend
is lost and should remember that, he could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
follow either one of them and not come out
wrong."</p>

<p>Dave was more than merely lost, Paul thought
and said so. And, "You know this country
pretty well," he added, addressing the former
speaker. "You belonged to the Longknives,"
he went on rather tartly. "It will be the last
of the old clubhouse."</p>

<p>"Yes, one blot will be wiped out. It is only
too bad that so much that is good must go
with it."</p>

<p>Paul glanced at Phil and his eyes also met
Billy's. The man's words were puzzling.</p>

<p>"We saw&#8211;" Paul began, but a shout interrupted
him&#8211;</p>

<p>"<i>There's</i> Dave! There's Dave now and some
man with him!" yelled Chip Slider suddenly.
His voice was like a burst of ecstasy. His eyes
scanning the distant shore, he had instantly
caught sight of the two hats waved as a signal.</p>

<p>The joy of the three chums, that the fourth
member of their almost inseparable quartette
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
was safe and sound, it would take pages to
describe. With the most delighted waving of
his own hat, Phil shouted to MacLester about
the skiff still moored on the north shore. His
voice was lost in the roar of the wind and the
flames now sweeping very near the water's
edge. By signals, however, he quickly made
Dave understand and the latter and the man
with him were seen to hurry forward to where
the boat was tied.</p>

<p>All the time the golfing man watched MacLester
and the person with him keenly. "Impossible!"
he muttered at last. "I thought
for a moment I knew the old chap your friend
seems to have in tow."</p>

<p>But it was not impossible, apparently, for
even before MacLester and his chums could exchange
greetings, as the skiff drew near, the
small, elderly man in the stern of the boat
cried: "Oh! 'tis there ye air then, Mr. Beckley!
Oh, ho! hurray! I dunno!" A laugh that
was equally like a sob accompanied the words,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
and "Oh, ho! oh, ho! I dunno!" the old fellow
cried again and again.</p>

<p>"It's 'Daddy' O'Lear, right from my own
home," the golfing man explained briefly.</p>

<p>The three boys again exchanged quick glances.
Instantly as he heard the name "Beckley" Phil
had remembered the initial B on the shaving
cup found in the clubhouse. Was the man trying
to carry on a deception even as to his
name, and at such a time, his thoughts inquired.
No, he quickly decided, there was some mistake.</p>

<p>"I do hope it may be no bad news he may
be sent with, Meester Beckley," said Mrs.
Anderson. She had been sitting silent on one
of the boxes Billy provided, the little girl leaning
on her knees. All the Andersons had
watched the fire constantly, their heavy hearts
revealed in their sad faces.</p>

<p>"I&#8211;I think not," spoke the man in a puzzled
way, glancing toward the fire now almost bursting
through the shore line.</p>

<p>"It will be hot here, and dangerous," said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
Phil, looking in the same direction. "We must
shove down the lake. Our poles won't reach
to go out farther. The water's too deep. We'll
lie off opposite the marsh near the Point."</p>

<p>Shouting to the approaching boat to follow,
Way and Billy slowly pushed their heavy craft
to the west. The skiff overtook them easily
and quickly.</p>

<p>"Hello!" grinned Paul Jones as Dave faced
quickly about when the boat came alongside.
But his half-jocular tone fell on ears attuned
to serious matters.</p>

<p>"Oh! this is a terrible thing," said MacLester,
his eyes fixed on the flood of flames.</p>

<p>"I was never so glad as I am this minute!
What in the world happened to you, Dave?
But never mind; you're safe now," Way answered
with emphasis.</p>

<p>Somehow all felt it was no time for conversation.
Dave made no response to Phil's
question. But Billy Worth&#8211;Chef Billy&#8211;remembered
one thing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>"Have you had anything to eat?" he demanded.
"I'll bet you haven't!"</p>

<p>"Mighty little&#8211;either of us," was the answer.
"We were lost,&#8211;just about."</p>

<p>"Here's something!" and Worth drew a
basket out from beneath a blanket. "Guess
we'll all feel better for a bite of breakfast," he
added.</p>

<p>Crackers, cheese, bread and butter and bananas
were in the "ship's stores," as Billy expressed
it, and there was enough for all.</p>

<p>The simple matter of eating served not only
to relieve hunger but gave all present a sense
of better acquaintance and far greater freedom
in talking with one another.</p>

<p>"'Tis an awful waste of wood, sure!" said
Mr. O'Lear.</p>

<p>Obviously he referred to the fire. The flames
now swept the shore line from the Point to
the lake's eastern boundary. For miles upon
miles the forest was a whirlwind of furiously
roaring flames, or a desolate waste of blazing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
wreckage, smoldering stumps and blackened,
leafless tree trunks.</p>

<p>"The clubhouse! The roof has caught!"
cried Billy Worth suddenly. "And look! It's
a man!&#8211;two men, on the porch roof!" he yelled.</p>

<p>"Great heavens! it's Lew Grandall!" cried
the stranger on the raft. "And the other man!
They're fighting!"</p>

<p>"It's Murky! The other one is Murky!"
Paul's sharp voice fairly shrieked. "It's the
suit-case! They have the suit-case! Murky's
trying to get it away from him!"</p>

<p>"Oo&#8211;ho there!" shouted the golfing man
with all his force. "Get to the ground! The
fire's all around you! Get into the lake quick
or you're dead men!"</p>

<p>For an instant the two who fiercely struggled
on the small balcony seemed to answer to the
voice. Grandall would have leaped, it was apparent,
but the other seized him furiously, and
drew him forcibly back. Then a thick burst
of smoke concealed them both.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>SETTING WRONG THINGS RIGHT</span></h2>

<p>Wearily had Lewis Grandall lain himself
down to sleep in his hot, close room. It was
his last night in the old clubhouse. He might
have been quite comfortable, so far as his
physical self was concerned, had he been willing
to open the door-like window that led to
the small balcony and admit the air; but this he
feared to do.</p>

<p>Some sense of danger, a feeling of some
dreadful peril impending, harassed him. He
tried to reason it all out of his mind. He had
not felt so before having actually in his possession
the moldy, discolored leather suit-case,
he reflected. Why should it make a difference?</p>

<p>There was no good cause for its doing so,
he told himself, and resolved to think of other
things. But always his thoughts came back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
to the one point&#8211;some great peril close before
him. What was it? He could not fathom the
distress of his own mind.</p>

<p>Often as Grandall tried wearily to forget, to
turn and sleep, some lines of a tale he had
somewhere heard or read,&#8211;a pirate's song
you'll recognize as being in a book of Stevenson's&#8211;struck
into his mind. It was as if someone
sang or called aloud to him:&#8211;</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest!</p>
<p>Yo-ho-ho! And a bottle of rum!"</p>
</div>

<p>In vain he told himself that it was nothing&#8211;nothing!
That he must not let himself fall a
prey to such silly dread, an unidentified fear,
like a child afraid in the dark. But ever the
sense of peril oppressed him. Ever there
came to his haunted thoughts&#8211;</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest!</p>
<p>Yo-ho-ho! And a bottle of rum!"</p>
</div>

<p>At last he rose and sat a long time on the
edge of the bed. Then he dressed himself. For
a great while, as the night crept slowly on, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
sat thus fully clothed. He did not know why
he did this. The fear of some unknown, threatening
thing was not removed or altered. The
ringing in his brain&#8211;</p>

<p>"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest!"
was just as it had been before.</p>

<p>He lighted a match and looked at his watch.
Four o'clock. Soon it would be daylight. Then
he would go&#8211;leave this terrible place forever!
Leave everything he hated&#8211;and that was all
persons and all things. Leave the guilt he
vowed he would never face&#8211;if he could. So
thinking, he lay down once more and sheer exhaustion
let the wretched man sink into heavy
slumber.</p>

<p>Lynx-eyed, the scowling Murky waited. The
black shadows of the thick shrubbery near the
clubhouse door concealed him. A long, long
time passed. It was quite evident, the tramp
reflected, that the man with the suit-case had
gone to bed.</p>

<p>Should he break in on him? Break in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
house, slip up to his bed, strike one swift blow
and end the whole search for that twenty thousand
dollars quickly? End it all so quietly
that the one who had played him false would
never be conscious of the outcome?</p>

<p>No, that was not the plan Murky chose to
follow. It might result in his obtaining the
prize he sought, but he desired more. He
wanted revenge. He wanted Grandall to know,
too, that he <i>was</i> avenged,&#8211;would have him
fully realize that it was Murky,&#8211;Murky whom
he had tricked and deceived, that had found
him out and vanquished him at last.</p>

<p>Daylight was necessary to the tramp's plan.
He wanted Grandall to see and recognize him.
He pictured in his mind how, when suddenly
awakened, the trickster should find looking
down into his face a pair of eyes that were
sharper and just as unmerciful as his own.
Then he would speak, make sure he was known&#8211;strike
quickly and effectively, and be gone.</p>

<p>He would not commit murder&#8211;unless obliged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
to do so; it might make trouble. But he would
leave Grandall so hopelessly senseless that there
would be no possibility of early pursuit from
that quarter, as there would probably be none
from any other.</p>

<p>Oh, they were black, black thoughts that
coursed in Murky's mind!&#8211;hardly the thoughts
that should come to a man in his last night on
earth. But they were very pleasing to the
tramp. With a kind of wild, wolfish relish,
he pondered over the details of his plan.</p>

<p>Satisfied that Grandall would not leave the
clubhouse before morning, confident of his own
ability to awaken at the slightest sound of footsteps
near, and resolving to be astir before
daybreak, anyway, if he were not disturbed
earlier, which he regarded as quite improbable,
the scowling wretch allowed his eyes to close.</p>

<p>Even in sleep Murky's face bore an expression
little short of fiendish. He was lying
quite under the thick foliage of the bushes.
They screened him from view and from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
breeze that had sprung up out of the west.
But also they screened from his eyes the glow
that now lit up the heavens, in the distance, for
miles around.</p>

<p>It was the smoke, strong in his nostrils, that
at last startled the fellow into sudden wakefulness.
He had been too long a woodsman, had
had too thorough a knowledge of the great
forests in his earlier, better days, not to know
instantly what it meant. He sprang up and
looked about. The course of the wind was such,
he reasoned, that the fire would not reach this
particular vicinity. But what if it should?
Why, so much the better, he reflected. The
clubhouse would burn. If Grandall, dead or
unconscious, burned with it&#8211;Murky's smile
was hideous.</p>

<p>For some time he watched the progress of
the fire, yet in the distance. But presently he
became aware that the daylight was near. It
was time for him to act.</p>

<p>Stealthily Murky crept to the broken window
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
at the west side of the clubhouse and entered.
He knew the first floor doors were locked, but
he did not know that Grandall had secured his
bedroom door. This he discovered in due time.
Just outside the room he listened. Sounds of
heavy breathing assured him his victim slept.</p>

<p>It took a good while for Murky's heavy knife
to cut in a panel of the pine door a hole large
enough to permit him to reach in and turn the
key; for he worked very slowly, very quietly.
The daylight was coming in at the window of
the narrow hallway when his task was done&#8211;the
daylight, the dull glare of the advancing
flames and the sound of their roar and fury.</p>

<p>The door creaked slightly as ever so slowly
its hinges were moved, but in another second
Murky stood inside.</p>

<p>The man on the bed awoke&#8211;leaped to his
feet&#8211;saw&#8211;recognized&#8211;gave forth a yell the
like of which even the wildest places have
seldom heard.</p>

<p>Instantly Grandall knew his danger. Seizing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
the leather case, for whose stolen contents
he had risked so much, he threw open the balcony
window. In another moment he would
have leaped to the ground below but Murky
caught him and they grappled.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of this first fierce struggle
that the two were seen by those on the raft.
Murky's greater strength was fast overpowering
the other's soft muscles. Grandall breathed
in choking gasps.</p>

<p>Then came the shouted warning from the
lake. For an instant the surprise of it caused
the tramp to relax his hold, but only for an
instant.</p>

<p>"Blame <i>me</i>!" like some wild beast he
growled, though there was savage delight in
his tones as well, "Blame <i>me</i>! but I'd as soon
leave my bones here as anywhere, to see you
get what's comin' to ye, you lyin' skunk!" He
fairly hissed the epithet in Grandall's ear.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Murky first drew
his panting adversary back into the flaming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
clubhouse. Grandall knew he was no match
for his enemy in strength.</p>

<p>"Wait, you fool!" he gasped. "There's
a fortune for you&#8211;ease&#8211;luxury! Take it! I'll
add as much more to it!"</p>

<p>As the lying wretch hoped, Murky's wild
thoughts were for the moment attracted by the
words. His grip upon Grandall's great, fat
neck was weakened. Like lightning and with
a vicious curse the latter threw him off, put
forth all his strength and hurled the tramp to
the floor.</p>

<p>For himself there was aid in sight, was
Grandall's thought. If he could escape to the
water below, he could make some explanation
to those on the raft, whoever they might be.
They would save him from the fire and from
Murky, whom he feared still more.</p>

<p>Far more quickly than you read the words,
the idea flashed in the mind of the frightened
scoundrel. The instant he freed himself he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
leaped again through the window. With the
yell of an enraged maniac Murky followed.</p>

<p>The Auto Boys and their companions on the
great raft, floating but a few hundred feet from
shore, saw Grandall reappear. With horrified
faces they saw about him the smoke and flame
that now raged in the roof above, and throughout
the whole lower floor of the clubhouse, below
the balcony,&#8211;saw him seize the leather case
and pitch it far forward to the water's edge&#8211;saw
him glance down as if, in desperation, to
leap.</p>

<p>Again a blood-thirsty savage scream sounded
above the fury of the fire and wind, and Murky
also appeared on the flame-shrouded balcony.</p>

<p>Grandall was too late. No more than a child
could he cope with the mad strength of his assailant.
Like a great bag of meal, or other
heavy, limp and lifeless thing he was dragged in
through the open, blazing window. A fiendish
but triumphant yell once more came out of
the leaping smoke and flame. It was the voice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
of the infuriated tramp, to be heard on earth
again, no more forever.</p>

<p>Dazed, powerless, speechless, those on the
lake helplessly witnessed the awful tragedy.
With straining eyes and ears they watched and
listened; but there came now no sound above
the fitful roar and crackle of the fire and the
surging wind.</p>

<p>Within a minute the roof of the clubhouse
went down. The whole interior of the building
followed, and where had stood the old house
on the Point there remained only the walls of
flaming logs, the mass of debris and the wreckage
of wrecked lives that rapidly burned within
them.</p>

<p>"You know what's in that bag he threw down
to the water?" the golfing man asked. It was
in the midst of the exclamation and words of
awe of those who saw the terrible scene enacted,
that the question was asked of Anderson. The
Swede nodded.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>"And you?" said the stranger, turning to
Phil as spokesman for the boys.</p>

<p>"Yes, we know. We know the whole story.
We&#8211;we thought <i>you</i> were&#8211;We saw you about
the clubhouse and we got it into our heads
that <i>you</i> were&#8211;Was it really Grandall that we
saw on the balcony?"</p>

<p>"Thought <i>I</i> was Grandall?" muttered the
man, mystified. "Why should you? Did you
know he was in the woods? For I did not. But
it was Lewis Grandall and no other that went
to his death before our very eyes! The man
with him&#8211;Murky was the name you used?
Who was he?"</p>

<p>"Then you don't <i>know</i> the <i>whole story</i> of
the robbery?" exclaimed Billy Worth. "Murky
was the man Grandall got to go through the
motions of robbing him of the twenty thousand
dollars in the first place!"</p>

<p>It was with great interest, indeed, that Mr.
Beckley heard the complete account of Grandall's
double-dealing scheme as Chip Slider and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
the Auto Boys had gathered the information.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there had come with the wind fitful
dashes of rain that soon settled itself to a
steady downpour. The forest fire had nearly
burned itself out on the lake's south shore.
Thousands of acres of smoldering ruins lay in
its wake. Yet for a long time the refugees huddled
upon the raft, protecting themselves from
the storm as best they could with blankets and
bedding. Not yet was it safe to venture ashore.</p>

<p>It was during this period that the golfing
man made known his own identity and told
why he happened to be hiding in the old clubhouse,
resulting quite naturally, he freely admitted,
in his being taken for the fugitive
treasurer of the Longknives.</p>

<p>His name was Henry Beckley, he explained,
and he had been one of the most active members
of the Longknives Club. He had never
been quite satisfied that the club's treasurer
was really robbed of the money intended for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
road builders, but had never found any genuine
evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>A long time had passed since the loss of the
money. The investigation of Grandall's crookedness,
at home, was taken up by the Grand
Jury. Mr. Beckley had reason to suspect the
man of a number of dishonest practices, but
feared for the safety of the bank, in which he
was heavily interested, if the public suddenly
learned that Grandall was a thief.</p>

<p>To avoid being called as a witness in the
matter he decided to go away until the investigation
was over. He would keep his going and
his destination a secret from all, his own family
excepted, he planned, and with no one suspecting
where he might be, visit Opal Lake. Living in
concealment at the clubhouse he would have
an opportunity of investigating his suspicion
that Grandall had made up the robbery story.
Also he would satisfy himself, at least, that
Nels Anderson had had no part in the disappearance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
of the payroll money and settle, for
all time, occasional rumors to the contrary.</p>

<p>Mr. Beckley had reached the lake only a
day or two before the Auto Boys set up their
camp there. He avoided them for he wished to
work in secret. Also, for fear other strangers,
or even some who might know him, should
chance to visit the lake, he was careful not to
disturb the deserted appearance of the clubhouse.
He burned no light at night, and rarely
sat anywhere but in his bedroom.</p>

<p>"You had a light there one night," spoke
Paul. "We saw it flicker for just a second
once, then after while saw the same thing
again."</p>

<p>"It must have been matches to light my cigar
that you saw," Mr. Beckley replied. "I knew
you had discovered me and that in part was
one reason that I went to Anderson's to stay.
He brought me some provisions one evening
and I agreed then to go to his house, and I did
so within a day or two."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>Paul could have said "Yes, <i>I</i> knew he came
to see you," if he had wished. But he was
silent.</p>

<p>But MacLester spoke up: "And you went
down on the old pier and threw something into
the water the last thing before leaving. We
saw that, too!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you're right. All the scraps of my
lunches and the like I tied up and, putting a
stone in the package to sink it to the bottom
of the lake, I threw it in. You must have had
pretty sharp eyes for the Point," the speaker
added, pleasantly. "But it is no wonder. I
would have been even more interested in my own
investigations than I was had I known half as
much of the true story of the Grandall robbery
as you boys knew. And had I known of that
awful Murky being around I'd most certainly
have gone to stay with good old Nels Anderson
much sooner than I did."</p>

<p>"Sure, I am worried sick to know what ever
I would ha' done, a gettin' to the hoose an' not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
findin' of ye there," put in Daddy O'Lear with
a sorrowful shake of his head.</p>

<p>Mr. Beckley's faithful follower had already
given that gentleman and MacLester an account
of his adventures ending in his sudden appearance
on the north shore, as the three sat by
themselves in the boat some time earlier. Now
the story was repeated for the information of
all.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beckley, it appeared, having learned of
the flight of Grandall wished her husband to
be informed of this development. He had cautioned
her that he could receive no letters without
revealing where he was, and she could not
write or telegraph. So with many instructions
as to secrecy she sent the old family gardener,
Daddy O'Lear, to tell all that had occurred.</p>

<p>The well-meaning old fellow left the train at
a town to the north of Opal Lake, as told to do.
He became quite confused and lost in the woods
as he sought the clubhouse, and when he chanced
to learn from MacLester that he had actually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
reached Opal Lake, though quite without knowing
it, he was greatly alarmed. He feared the
nature of his errand would be discovered by
the young campers.</p>

<p>On the pretext of going for his baggage he
walked back into the forest, MacLester accompanying
him, instead of crossing over to the
boys' camp. He wanted to gain time to think
and plan. He finally decided that, a long way
into the woods, he would give MacLester the
slip and later reach the clubhouse and Mr.
Beckley secretly, by walking around the lake to
the other side.</p>

<p>This plan might have been more successful
had "Daddy" not lost himself more hopelessly
than ever, before he was ready to put it into
execution. And if it had not been for Dave
serving as his guide, at last, the good-natured
Irishman never would have found his way to
the lake again at all. This he freely admitted.</p>

<p>"I was satisfied that the stream we found
must lead to the lake, or to some larger stream
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
that would do so," MacLester explained. "We
were a long time getting here, but when I saw
the fire burning so terribly I didn't know
whether to be glad or sorry we had saved ourselves.
Then I saw the raft, and&#8211;<i>believe me</i>!"</p>

<p>Very soon after reaching his friends MacLester
had learned of the loss of the automobile.
Naturally thoughts of the car were in the
mind of every one of the boys, even in the
midst of all they had lately passed through.
But no word of complaint or grief was spoken.
Possibly Mr. Beckley noticed this for his own
thoughts were not idle.</p>

<p>The rain still fell in torrents, hissing and
steaming in the smoldering ruins of the great
fire. But the heat was almost gone now. The
shore could be approached without inconvenience.
Mentioning this, the golfing man suggested
that it would now be possible to see if
the general suspicion concerning the suit-case
Grandall had thrown to the water's edge was
correct.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>The skiff was moored to the raft. Dave
and Phil entered the boat and rowed up past
the rotting and now half burned timbers of
the old pier. The leather case had fallen
partially into the water they saw, but quickly
they recovered it.</p>

<p>"In spite of what has happened to this
money, and we all know the terrible history
now&#8211;I suppose we must agree that this bag
and its contents are still the property of the
Longknives Club," said Mr. Beckley solemnly.
For, unopened, Phil had passed the discolored
case at once to him. "At any rate," the
speaker went on, very soberly, "we will see
what is in it. I have a few things in mind regarding
the club's disposition of this matter."</p>

<p>Without hesitation Mr. Beckley picked up the
leather case and eyed it with a growing suspicion.
It was now battered, almost shapeless.
More than that it looked, somehow, almost too
small. Finding that it was locked, he cut open
one of the sides with his pocket knife.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>But, instead of packages of bank notes and
bags of gold and silver coin, there was disclosed
brushes, comb, and a few other toilet accessories,
together with a limited change of underwear
and one bosom shirt. Of course these were
soiled by mud and water, but not unduly discolored.</p>

<p>The varied expressions of dismay, vexation
and amazement shown by those on the raft and
in the skiff were almost comical.</p>

<p>Nels Anderson ventured an opinion that the
bag was Grandall's, but wondered why the man
had heaved it over first instead of jumping with
it himself.</p>

<p>"He must have been crazed by terror," said
Mr. Beckley. "But the question now is what
did he do with the larger suit-case. He certainly
had it somewhere, or that chap Murky
wouldn't have been hanging round."</p>

<p>"Do you think both those men were burned
to death?" This from Dave.</p>

<p>"I don't see how either could have escaped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
The building was in flames when they disappeared.
It is almost night and we're all tired.
I think we perhaps had better to go back to
camp, sleep quietly, and then in the morning
we can search the ruins and see what we may
find."</p>

<p>As everyone was weary, this received general
assent. They were not only weary but discouraged.
The unexpected and mysterious loss of
the suit-case containing the money was, in
itself, an unlooked-for defeat, and just as
everyone felt sure that their difficulties were
solved.</p>

<p>Scarcely had they reached the old camping
ground than out of the still smoking wilderness
came a loud shout. Link Fraley, his shapeless
old hat pulled down almost over his eyes, his
horses and wagon steaming wet and coated with
ashes, drove up at a trot.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" he cried. "We've been worried
about you all. Staretta's gone wild over
this fire. Worried about the Andersons and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
the Auto Boys; and I'm more worried about
what I saw on the way here."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that last?" asked Mr.
Beckley, who was quick to hear the unusual
note in this final remark by Fraley. "What
did you see?"</p>

<p>"I ain't certain; but I'm almost sure I saw
that scowling fellow we called Murky. I didn't
get but a glimpse. 'Twas a mile or so back,
where the half burnt logs was piled up thicker
than usual near the trail. Before I could stop
my team he was gone. No use to foller; besides,
I was in a hurry to get on to where the
camp was, hoping I'd find you folks all right."</p>

<p>Link's news occasioned somewhat of a flutter
among the weary party thus gathered at the
ruins of what had once been the Auto Boys'
camp. After some discussion, while Chip and
Worth were roasting potatoes and preparing
hot coffee, it was determined that, after eating,
they would return with Fraley to Staretta and
sleep in warm beds once more. After that plans
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
might be made for investigating what Link had
seen on the way over.</p>

<p>They hastened their meal and then, all climbing
into the wagon, they started back. Probably
a mile further on Fraley pointed at a confused
tangle of fallen trees and logs which the
fire had partially consumed, yet left in such
profusion as to form a sooty labyrinth where a
fugitive might easily escape unseen in that
growing twilight. By now the moon was shining,
for the rain had long passed. Link stopped
the wagon and was pointing out where he had
caught this flying glimpse. He was about to
start on again when Phil Way, crouched at the
wagon's tail-board, cried out as he jumped off:</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute, Link! I think I see something!"</p>

<p>Mr. Beckley, beside him, had seen it too, for
the moonlight made things more distinct than
when Fraley had passed an hour or so before.
Beckley also descended.</p>

<p>When he reached Phil, the boy was raising
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
up a sooty, battered leather suit-case with several
holes burnt partially through its thick
sides. A wide flap was cut through the leather.
It hung down as Phil held it up. It was some
larger than the other bag and Beckley instantly
knew that he was looking at the receptacle that
had held the money.</p>

<p>Had held it, but now no longer.</p>

<p>"It's empty, Mr. Beckley. How did he come
to leave it here?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you see? Look at those holes."
Beckley pulled at the edge of one and the burnt
leather parted easily. "Murky&#8211;of course it
was he&#8211;must have seen that this bag would
no longer safely hold his plunder."</p>

<p>"Then he's taken it out and put it into something
else," said Way. "Perhaps his coat, if
he had one left."</p>

<p>"No; here's what looks like it had once been
a coat."</p>

<p>Further search under the moon revealed only
that certain foot tracks, found by Paul Jones,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
led off to the left through the wet ashes, as if
the party who made them was in a great hurry.
But, search as they might, only one pair of foot
tracks could be seen.</p>

<p>"Evidently Grandall did not survive," said
Beckley. "No wonder! He must have been all
in when that scoundrel dragged him back inside
the burning building. But how could
Murky have gotten out alive? Probably Grandall,
in his frantic haste, must have caught up
the wrong bag, for it was the money he was
after. When Grandall was finished his companion
would, of course, try to make sure of the
loot which both had schemed so hard to get and
keep."</p>

<p>Reasoning thus, they all went on to Staretta,
for nothing could be done that night, or without
bloodhounds, which the county sheriff was
known to have at his home at the county seat.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>WAS THIS THE END OF MURKY?</span></h2>

<p>When the still struggling Grandall was
dragged inside by Murky and hurled through
the burning bedroom door into the flames beyond,
the latter had one resource left, though it
is doubtful if he would have thought of that but
for one fact. In the brief struggle they had
stumbled over another suit-case than the one
Grandall had heaved to the water's edge.</p>

<p>Murky recalled that when he had at first entered
he had seen two bags. One was the bag
containing the money. Another, a trifle
smaller, was the one brought by Grandall containing
articles for his personal use while in
the woods. In the fight Grandall had grabbed
the smaller, whether by mistake or not will
never be known. But in such a death-and-life
struggle as went on, with Murky indisputably
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
the best man, such a mistake was likely, more
than likely, to have been made by the despairing,
frightened thief then being overpowered
by a more ferocious, desperate rogue.</p>

<p>In less than a second Murky knew that there
lay the treasure for which he had run such a
terrible risk, and also that his only competitor
was gone. Little would the fire leave of Grandall
for after-recognition, when the ruins were
searched. The heat was unbearable; Murky's
clothing was already ablaze in spots. On the
stand was a can of water, left by the now dead
man.</p>

<p>In a twinkling he poured it over himself,
seized the suit-case already scorched, and
dashed for an open closet door. In this closet
was a displaced trap door. Murky knew that
under this was the hallway leading to the cellar
stairs. In the cellar might be present safety&#8211;if
he could make it. The clubhouse had
caught from the roof. Probably the cellar was
not yet reached. All this in less than no time,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
as he darted to the closet, kicked aside the trap
which Grandall had overlooked, and jumped
boldly down to the floor he had glimpsed beneath.</p>

<p>Murky was strong, tough, and such a leap
was easily made. Already the lower rear rooms
were blazing, and he had barely time to rush
through the advancing flames to reach the stair
door. Jerking it open, he stumbled through,
hurrying down into the obscurity below. It
was not so dark as usual, for the wide flare of
the burning house above lighted up the cellar
dimly, also showing to Murky the gleam of a
cellar window off to one side, the last side to be
encroached upon by the fire.</p>

<p>There were smoke and sparks outside, while
sundry sparkles overhead told him that the
floors might shrivel into flames at any minute.
In fact crumbs of blazing embers already were
filtering down. In the light thus afforded, he
saw some tow-bagging piled on one of the boxes
that littered the cellar floor. At the same time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
a jingling thud announced that some of the
coin had fallen from the scorched suit-case.</p>

<p>At once he seized the bagging, picked up the
chamois-bag of coin and wrapped it round the
leather case, including the escaped coin. With
a rock from the crumbling wall he broke what
remained of the window and crawled through.</p>

<p>Fortunately for him he was on the opposite
side from the balcony where the amazed group
on the raft and skiff were still watching, although
they, too, were on the point of quitting.</p>

<p>Which way should he go? The rain was beginning
to fall though the woods were still
burning. But, close by, a small lagoon began.
It was a part of the water that separated the
point on which the clubhouse was built, making
it an eligible site for the purposes of the Longknives
when they erected the house. It offered
Murky a chance and he jumped at it as a drowning
man will dash for a straw. The water was
shallow, yet deep enough to keep off much of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
the heat as he waded along, crouching, half
creeping, his treasure now over his shoulder as
he hurried to where the lagoon widened towards
the open lake.</p>

<p>Here he waited while the rain poured down
drenchingly, gradually putting out the fires that
here had not the fierceness that had driven them
in from the westward. As soon as it was possible
he stepped ashore, walking as he thought
towards the east and south. He was still trying
to make sure of his course and the rain was
still coming down when he heard the rattling of
wagon wheels off to his right.</p>

<p>"Blame <i>me</i>!" he ejaculated. "What the&#8211;the&#8211;what
can that be?"</p>

<p>Twilight was near, the air dim with falling
rain, when a rough wagon, drawn by two horses
driven by one man whom he thought he knew,
came in sight. Before Murky could get out of
view behind the sooty, smoking logs, he himself
was seen. Link Fraley had been urging
his horses faster. Before he could slow down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
the scowling face he had seen was gone, as Link
himself had told the others.</p>

<p>He felt sure that he knew that face, but being
unacquainted with the events at the clubhouse,
already described, he was in too great haste
to reach the lake to stop and further investigate.
So Link passed on while Murky, now sure that
he was headed wrongly, turned away.</p>

<p>In order to make greater haste he took the
money, bills and all, from the dilapidated bag,
thrust it all inside the tow sack, and turning at
last to the course he had mistakenly thought he
was following, he disappeared within those
slimy, sooty depths of the fire-ruined forest.</p>

<p>He plodded on, wondering at times if he was
going right. Later in the night it became
cloudy and there were symptoms of more rain.
Strange to say, he did not reach any farms or
houses or other signs of the railroad which he
felt sure must run in this direction. That is,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
if he had kept the course previously laid out by
himself.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, the going was not easy.
The earth, at times strangely swampy, grew
more and more difficult to pursue. He wiped
the sweat from his head and neck more than
once.</p>

<p>"Blame me!" he ejaculated. "Why don't I
git somewhere? Looks like I've travelled long
enough and fur enough!"</p>

<p>When it began to rain again he was compelled
to take off his one remaining coat to wrap round
the tow sack of money to keep it, at least, partially
dry.</p>

<p>"The bulk of this money is paper," he reflected.
"Paper won't stand too much wetting;
not even gov'ment paper such as money is made
of. Blame me! Wish I had a rubber blanket!"</p>

<p>Crossing a log over a slough just before daylight,
feeling his way slowly, yet not daring to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
stop until he reached some sign of railroad or
clearing, or at least a house or barn, his foot
slipped on a log and down he went into a black
pool of mud-encrusted water.</p>

<p>"Ugh&#8211;ow-w-w-wh!"</p>

<p>Would his feet <i>never</i> strike bottom? Yes&#8211;at
last. But the water was up to his shoulders:
the bag, coat and all was partly in the slime
that wrapped him coldly, icily about. Though
the night was summery, the chill of that involuntary
bath was unpleasant. More than unpleasant;
it was exhausting, even terrifying.
He tried to wade out, but the mire deepened.
He turned and tried to find the log again, but
in the darkness all sense of direction seemed to
have left him.</p>

<p>At last, when even Murky's resolution
was about to give way to despair, his outstretched
hand touched a limb. Convulsively
he grasped it, both arms going out in eager hope
to grasp something tangible amid that inky,
nauseous blackness. As he did so a cry broke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
from him, for he felt the bag slipping from his
shoulder. He clutched it desperately.</p>

<p>"Oh! Ugh-h! My Gawd!" The cry broke
into stranglings as his head went under. A
furious struggle then began, for Murky was not
one to give up his hold on life, or plunder, or
anything valuable to him, without fighting.</p>

<p>Somehow he grasped at the unseen limb. It
broke just as his weight began to hang thereon.
More splashings, strugglings. He found another
limb, all dead, sooty, yet wet from the now
pouring rain.</p>

<p>This one seemed to hold. Inch by inch Murky
drew one leg, then the other from the sucking
mud below, but as fast as one leg was released
the other stuck fast again. It was like working
in a treadmill, only far more perilous, fatiguing,
and terrible. Would he ever get out&#8211;rescue
himself?</p>

<p>After all, love of life was more powerful than
money or aught else.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>SEARCHING FOR CLUES</span></h2>

<p>The next morning, though it was still cloudy
and rain was falling, Link was prevailed to return
with his team to the place where he had
seen the man with the scowling visage. Meantime
Nels Anderson and family had been made
comfortable in a disused cabin in the edge of
the village.</p>

<p>Nels, being comparatively useless, also remained.
To him later in the day came Chip
Slider, saying:</p>

<p>"I went with them folks and they didn't do
nothin' much, except that Paul picked up a gold
piece right near where they found that old suit-case.
All at once it come to me that something's
got to be did."</p>

<p>"Vell, vot you bane goin' to do?" Nels spoke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
indifferently, for he had his own troubles heavily
on his mind.</p>

<p>"I don't want you to say much to the others.
But if you find they ain't goin' to foller up that
trail we lost in them burnt woods, 'count of the
rain, I'm goin' to foller it myself. Say, Nels,
I want to get your wife to cook me up some
grub&#8211;on the quiet, see?"</p>

<p>"On de qviet&#8211;heh? V'ot for you bane goin'
to do?" Nels was vaguely suspicious but
kindly.</p>

<p>"They've gone for the sheriff and the dawgs.
But they won't get back afore ter-morrer. I
want that grub right away&#8211;see?"</p>

<p>Nels grunted a surly assent, adding: "Don'
you forget to bring dat grub."</p>

<p>This Chip proceeded to do, managing to secure
through Billy Worth and Phil Way a
limited amount of flour, bacon and one or more
minor ingredients. But both were curious,
naturally.</p>

<p>"Look here, Chip," remarked Phil casually.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
"You ain't going to leave us, are you? We&#8211;we
rather like you, boy."</p>

<p>Chip took them both aside as he explained his
purpose to some extent.</p>

<p>"You know Paul found a gold piece where
that suit-case was picked up. That shows as
how Murky, or whoever it was, must 'a' been
puttin' the money in something else. It's
rained on that trail, and even if the sheriff
comes with his dawgs, they can't foller it to do
any good."</p>

<p>"Well then, how the mischief can you follow
it?" demanded Worth. "You just can't! Believe
me, Chip, you're going up against a hard
thing."</p>

<p>But Chip persisted. The sooner he got off,
the better. After all, seeing he was bound to
go, they wished him luck. But meanwhile Paul
had come up and was listening eagerly. When
Phil and Billy turned away, he clapped Chip
on the back, saying:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>"Chip, you're the goods&#8211;sure! I'm going
with you, see?"</p>

<p>Chip looked so astonished that Paul hastened
to add: "Don't you worry! I'll have some
grub of my own, too. More'n that, I'll get a
couple of our camp blankets. Now that our
Thirty is gone, we won't be using much of our
camp supplies. Say, it's up to us to help get
back that twenty thousand dollars or what's
left of it&#8211;hey?"</p>

<p>So it was arranged. During the afternoon
Mr. Beckley and a constable came back but without
either the sheriff or the dogs. To the anxious
queries put to them Beckley shook his head
discouragingly.</p>

<p>"We talked to the sheriff. He seemed anxious
to do all he could; but he was positive that
the rains and the strong scent of burnt ashes
over soil would baffle the hounds. Said he:
'I'm used to bloodhounds. I know what I am
talking about. My dogs are useless here.' But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
he was insistent on our notifying the police of
the nearer towns by wire. He also 'phoned to
the nearest big cities, in case Murky turned up
at any of them. We gave a description of the
fellow as best we could, and also charged him
with murder."</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean Grandall," remarked
MacLester.</p>

<p>"Certainly! I think, considering what we
saw on the balcony especially when Murky was
dragging Grandall back into the burning building,
there can be little doubt but that Murky
made an end of him. It was undoubtedly to his
interest to get Grandall out of the way; especially
if Murky had a notion of making off with
the plunder himself."</p>

<p>No one disputed this. And so the matter
rested. During the day men were sent off to
notify the nearest settlers. In case Murky appeared,
they were to arrest the man or, if unable
to do that, to let folks in Staretta know at
once.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>Meanwhile Link Fraley, having turned the
store over temporarily to his father, who was
the real proprietor after all, and an assistant,
spent most of his time going round with the
Auto Boys and Mr. Beckley.</p>

<p>"It's this way," he remarked. "I've been
so much with you lads in this business that I
feel somehow as if we were all interested. By
the way, kids, where is that chap Slider? And
I don't see your chum Paul round here."</p>

<p>These remarks were made along in the afternoon,
after a busy morning of investigation
involving a good deal of running round generally.
For the first time it suddenly occurred
to three of the Auto Boys that one of their number
had not showed up, even at the dinner taken
at noon at the one tavern of the place. Also,
where was Chip Slider?</p>

<p>"Gee whiz-z!" Phil wondered that he had
not noticed their absence before. "I remember
him and Chip whispering together after we got
back. Don't you, Link?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>Link did and said so emphatically, adding:</p>

<p>"Now come to think, I seen them two
moseyin' off down where the Andersons be."</p>

<p>"By ginger!" This from MacLester. "I
bet they're off to help Nels fix up that old cabin
a bit. It sure needs fixing if I'm any judge."</p>

<p>"Tell you what, boys," put in Worth, "suppose
we all go down there and give poor Nels
a lift. He's half helpless himself. These
Staretta folks sent them in some things. We'll
do our bit while we're waitin' for Mr. Beckley
to get that automobile he thinks he needs."</p>

<p>Now that the Thirty belonging to the boys
had been destroyed Beckley, on reaching Staretta,
had sent a man to the nearest town to
bring some kind of motor car, for it was plain
to him that if he was to get anywhere with his
faithful assistant Daddy O'Lear, some kind of
assistance more to be depended on than Link's
scraggy horse team should be secured.</p>

<p>So while Beckley waited the boys set out for
Anderson's cabin. But upon reaching there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
no sign of either Paul or Chip was to be seen.
Instead Nels himself sat despondent in the
doorway, while inside Mrs. Anderson and the
child were striving in a desultory, hopeless way
to arrange the inside of the unkempt cabin.</p>

<p>"We came down to see if we could help about
anything to make you all more comfortable,"
said Phil, still looking for Jones and Chip.
"We kind a thought Paul and that Slider boy
was down here."</p>

<p>"So they was," remarked Mrs. Anderson,
apathetically wiping out a frying pan, "but
they went off soon as they had their grub
cooked. And a job it was, too."</p>

<p>"Just what do you mean, Mrs. Anderson?"
put in Billy uneasily.</p>

<p>"They was goin' somewhere, I think. Then&#8211;"</p>

<p>"Yah&#8211;yah!" This from Nels in the doorway.
"They bane had der dinners."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Phil was thinking what Chip had
told them that morning. Paul's absence was
now explained. Worth also felt that an astonishing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
light had dawned on him somehow.
He turned to Way, saying:</p>

<p>"What doughheads we were when Chip was
talking so glibly about what he was going to
do! Why, the thing is sheer nonsense!"</p>

<p>"More than that, it is dangerous!" exclaimed
Phil. "Suppose them two boys meet up with
Murky way off in the burnt over woods.
What'll Murky do to 'em?"</p>

<p>"Don't talk punk, Phil!" Billy was in cold
earnest now. "You know what he'd do or try
to do, if he thought they had come after that
money. There's nothing he <i>wouldn't</i> do if he
could, that would put them off his trail and land
them&#8211;oh, goodness! It makes me cold when I
think of Paul."</p>

<p>Here the Anderson girl timidly approached,
holding out a scrap of paper.</p>

<p>"He give it me," said the child. "Pap was
away and ma was busy."</p>

<p>"Who gave it you?" demanded Phil as Worth
took the soiled, folded paper.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>"One of you boys. They was leavin'. Ma
didn't know," seeing Mrs. Anderson looking
on with astonishment written all over her. "I
fergot it 'til now."</p>

<p>"Boys," the pencilled scrawl began. "I'm
off with Chip. We got some grub along, and a
pair of blankets. Chip thinks we can follow
Murky. I just got to go along, too. Paul.
P.S. Don't worry."</p>

<p>Nels' wife was fishing out a blanket from a
scant pile of bedding in one corner, and held
it out, saying:</p>

<p>"He says wrong, sir. They ain't got but one
blanket; for Mr. Paul he&#8211;offered us one of
the two he had. I wouldn't take it but he piled
it with the things folks brought in. Then they
both hurried off."</p>

<p>"Ve nefer see dat blanket," began Nels.
"No. He done left it. Mein frau, she find it
v'en day bane gone."</p>

<p>The situation now looked more grave to the
boys than ever. Little was said, however.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
Even Dave would only commit himself so far
as to ejaculate:</p>

<p>"Paul always was a fool!"</p>

<p>But this was said in no animadversive sense.
It was wholly sympathetic, even while Dave
might have disapproved. Finding there was
nothing more to be done for Nels they were
about to leave when Anderson, who had been
whispering with his wife, suddenly announced:</p>

<p>"I bane go mit you. I know de woods. I lif
in de woods. I go mit you!"</p>

<p>"It won't do, Nels," remonstrated Worth.
"You ain't fit. You're needed more here."</p>

<p>"How did you know we were going after Paul
and Chip?" asked Phil.</p>

<p>Nels smiled for the first time that day. His
wife explained.</p>

<p>"He knew you boys were good and that you
loved your chum. Perhaps he felt that you
were sorry for Chip, too. He wants to do his
part. But I think you are right. In his fix he'd
better stay with us."</p>

<p>All three boys insisted that Nels' place was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
with his family. It looked that way, anyhow.
But Nels shook his head rather grimly. Finally
he retired to the doorsteps, neither taking part
in further discussion nor saying much of anything
more at all.</p>

<p>After the boys left, however, he bestirred himself.
His wife, understanding him better than
others, mutely began preparing more food.
Meanwhile Nels, from some recess in his rough
clothing, resurrected two one-dollar bills.
These he forced upon his wife, who meantime
had wrapped up certain provisions and made
him take the blanket left by Paul.</p>

<p>On the way back to town the boys encountered
Link Fraley; and he, being in their confidence,
was briefly told all that had occurred. As they
explained the grin on Link's face grew broader,
his eyes twinkled and he seemed vastly tickled
at something.</p>

<p>"Well, what you goin' to do?" He asked it
as if he already knew.</p>

<p>They told him, and he slapped the boys on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
the shoulders congratulatingly as he rejoined:</p>

<p>"Bully for you, boys! Stick to your friends!
That's the way to git along in this world. That
little hungry looking cuss Chip&#8211;why, somehow
I kinder liked him. Lemme tell you something.
I'm goin' 'long, too."</p>

<p>Here Link's smile grew so broad that it
nearly met his ears. "I been doin' some
thinkin' of my own. I ain't after money in
this. Yet, if we should happen to git that
money back, or he'p 'em git it, I rather guess
Mr. Beckley would do the right thing."</p>

<p>"He would; I feel sure of that." Phil was
speaking. "But that isn't worrying us so much
as that Chip and Paul should start out that way
without even letting out a cheep what they was
up to."</p>

<p>"We-ell!" Link looked uncommonly wise.
"You see, they two had seen that ugly cuss
first. Then ag'in, I think Chip felt sore 'cause
Murky beat him up so. He'd sorter like to
git even, I reckon."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>"Another thing," put in Phil. "Chip knows
that his dead father didn't act up square 'bout
that money either. Grandall put him up to it.
But Chip, I'm thinkin', wants to do the fair
thing."</p>

<p>"You say you are going along, too?" asked
MacLester. "That is good of you, Mr. Fraley.
We've lost our car and the Longknives have
lost their money. I guess it's right that we
should all help to try to get the money back.
As for the car&#8211;our bully old Thirty&#8211;well,
we'll have to get home without it. But what
made Paul and Chip in such a hurry?"</p>

<p>"Chip's knocked about a good deal. He
knew that if Murky got out of the big woods
our chance to get him would be small." This
from Worth. "By the time it all got into the
hands of the police there'd be more or less costs
and&#8211;and expenses. As for Paul Jones, he just
couldn't help it, I guess."</p>

<p>"When will you be ready, Link?" queried
Phil. "That is, if you are really going along."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>"Ready right now, boys. When will you
start?"</p>

<p>"It's now mid-afternoon," remarked Phil.
"I propose we get ready and start at daylight
tomorrow. It has rained off and on all day&#8211;hullo!
Here comes Mr. Beckley."</p>

<p>Beckley, still followed by his henchman
Daddy O'Lear, came hurriedly out of the only
telephone office in Staretta. When he learned
what the boys together with Fraley were up
to, he looked dubious. Finally he said:</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is the best way after all. Nothing
more can be done here. Whether we recover
the money or not, it is right that you
should look after your chum and&#8211;and that
Slider boy." Mr. Beckley spoke this last as if
he rather had doubts if Chip were worth looking
after. But, with the Auto Boys on the
trail he felt safe as far as the money went, provided
they found Murky, and the spoil Murky
would be apt to have with him.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>TRAILING THE STOLEN MONEY</span></h2>

<p>Several miles away from the wagon trail that
led from Staretta to the now destroyed Longknives'
clubhouse, two boys were groping along
in the falling twilight in a discouraged manner.</p>

<p>Around them stretched seemingly endless
vistas of burned and blackened forest, stark,
leafless, forbidding. Under foot was a sooty,
miry quagmire of rain-soaked soil, naturally
low, swampy in places, and now all but impassable.
The rain had subsided into a misty drizzle,
soft, fine, yet penetrating.</p>

<p>"Gee but I'm tired, Chip!" said the younger
of the two, lifting with effort one foot after the
other from the deep mud underneath.</p>

<p>"Well, she <i>is</i> gettin' rather bad," replied the
other. "Won't be much moon tonight, I
reckon."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>"D'you suppose the other boys will start out
such a day as this?"</p>

<p>"Dunno; hard to tell. But we've come a
right smart ways, Paul, and so far as I kin see
we're gettin' further and further into these
big woods."</p>

<p>"But we've never lost old Murky's trail.
Have we, now?"</p>

<p>"Nope! Dark as it is, I kin make it out.
You know when we started out we noticed
that one of his shoes or boots had a prong
on one side of the heel. Well, here she is&#8211;see?"</p>

<p>And Chip Slider pointed to a deep impression
made apparently by a big shoe-nail or some
other peculiarity which the lads had noted
earlier when the light was better. Paul grunted
a tired assent.</p>

<p>"Where do you reckon we are, anyhow?"</p>

<p>Chip was staring at a high bulge ahead as
if some huge rock or boulder protruded upward
from the nearly level ground.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>"I dunno. There's something ahead that
looks like we might find a shelter. Come on,
Paul."</p>

<p>The two plodded on, one carrying the lone
blanket and the other the small store of eatables
that remained after their last inroad upon it.
When they were nearly up to this unusual obstruction
there came a sparkle of light that hit
the damp air momentarily, then went out. It
seemed to Chip, who had the keenest eyes of
the two, as if it might have been the flare of a
match.</p>

<p>The boys halted at once and stood staring,
listening, perplexed and yet most curious.
Finally they heard a snapping of twigs, and
then came another flare and still another.
Nothing else could they see for, as Chip suspected,
it was only the reflection of a light that
they had seen. Evidently there must be someone
behind that bulge. While they waited
breathless, there came a confirmation of their
fears&#8211;or rather was it their hopes?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>"Blame me!" growled a heavy voice. "Why
in sin won't she get afire?"</p>

<p>With one accord the two boys stood and
stared&#8211;at each other. Finally Paul leaned forward,
whispering:</p>

<p>"Murky, Murky!"</p>

<p>Chip more composedly nodded; then he too
whispered:</p>

<p>"We must slip up behind that thing. It's a
rock, I reckon."</p>

<p>Paul said nothing but when Chip started, he
did likewise.</p>

<p>"Step keerful," whispered Slider. "Don't
let your feet make a noise when you pull 'em
out of the mud."</p>

<p>A low rumble of thunder muttered its way out
of the west indicating more rain. As if to
emphasize the menace of this, they heard Murky
cursing to himself. He, too, was aware that
further rain and storm boded no good to himself.</p>

<p>More softly still the boys came gradually up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
under the shelving sides of a great rock, that
proved to be the termination of a chain of
similar rocks which abutted from a ridge of
low hills off to the northeast.</p>

<p>Beyond, on the other side of this last big
boulder, they could still hear Murky&#8211;if it was
Murky&#8211;renewing his attempts to make a fire.
Under the shelving sides the boys had some
shelter. But from the brighter glare on the
other side they knew that the tramp had succeeded
in starting his fire. Was he any
better protected from the increasing rain than
they?</p>

<p>For quite a time the two crouched, blanket
over their shoulders, while the rain pattered
harder and harder. Finally a slight shift of
wind to the westward caused the rain to beat
in on them more. They were very uncomfortable,
squatting in the wet mould with their
backs against the damp rocks.</p>

<p>"See what I got?" Paul held up something
that Chip cautiously felt.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>"Where did you get that?" Chip was astonished.</p>

<p>"I knew we had one at the camp. But I
thought it was lost. But today I found it in
one of our bags. When we started I managed
to slip it into my pocket. We're only two boys,
and Murky is a grown man. Why, you've got
bruises on you now that he gave you&#8211;" Paul
was showing a pistol.</p>

<p>"Hs-sh!" whispered Chip. "Not so loud.
Lemme see that gun!"</p>

<p>"All right," and Paul passed it over. Chip
looked at it closely. "I can't tell yet if the
chambers have any cartridges. We might need
it."</p>

<p>By the mere feel of the thing they did not
make sure, so Paul, before Chip had time to
remonstrate, struck one of his own matches.
By this light the two bent closely, the light flaring
out into the night air. At last, as the match
went out Chip declared:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>"The chambers are all empty except one, and
I can't see&#8211;hold on!"</p>

<p>Forgetting his previous caution, Chip himself
struck another match. While they bent
again to see if the cartridge was a full one they
were appalled when a deep, rough voice from
out the apparent wall of rock behind struck on
their boyish ears like a knell of coming destruction.</p>

<p>They turned, Paul grasping the dubious
pistol, while Murky, still wet, covered with mud
and doubly forbidding by reason of this, seized
Chip Slider in one hand and reached for Paul
with the other.</p>

<p>Where had Murky come from? How did he
suddenly appear apparently out of what the
boys supposed to be a solid wall of rock? But
at any rate there he was with Chip squirming
in his grasp while Paul, darting to one side,
barely eluded his left-handed clutch. Altogether
it was a ticklish situation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>But Paul was plucky. In a trice, remembering
the one cartridge, he levelled the pistol and
began pulling the trigger.</p>

<p>"Let go that boy!" his almost childish treble
rang out. "Leggo, I say!"</p>

<p>Click&#8211;click&#8211;click went the hammer as he
pulled the trigger, at the same time jumping
back further from Murky's gripping hand.
Meantime Chip managed to loose himself.
Murky, hearing the empty sound of the striking
hammer, growled:</p>

<p>"Huh-h! She's empty, blame ye&#8211;"</p>

<p>Just then&#8211;crack! came the sound of the full
cartridge; but Paul's aim being unsteady, the
ball just clipped Murky's left ear.</p>

<p>It maddened him more than anything else.
With a yell of rage and pain he sprang at Paul,
catching the lad as the latter tried to spring
backward, but stumbling in the mud, while the
pistol flew from his hand. By this time the light
of Murky's fire was blotted out by some passing
object that darted swiftly out of the obscurity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
whence Murky had sprung. At the same time
Chip, now free, leaped pluckily to the assistance
of his friend.</p>

<p>But on the instant the unknown object, emitting
a Swedish howl of rage, burst through,
striking Murky with an impact that sent him
headlong out into the night. With this collision
back came the light that had been momentarily
blotted from view by the last welcome intruder.</p>

<p>When this last stood revealed, big, heavy, yet
strangely hampered by his half useless arms,
the two boys were in turn again astonished yet
gratified to behold&#8211;Nels Anderson. Accompanying
this appearance came the sounds of
rapidly retreating steps as Murky, recognizing
defeat, made himself scarce as fast as he could.
The three looked at each other, grinning the
while as they looked.</p>

<p>"Say, Mr. Anderson," began Paul, "it was
bully of you to come, and you still crippled in
your arms!"</p>

<p>At a glance both saw that Nels, while active
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
as ever in body and legs, held his arms loosely,
both hanging down at his sides.</p>

<p>"My arms no good," he began, "but I bane
all right yet. Coom&#8211;ve look fer dot feller."</p>

<p>He turned, diving through a side passage
hitherto hidden from Paul and Chip, while they,
following, emerged into a recess where two gigantic
boulders, leaning together, made the
shelter under which Murky had started the fire
that, flaring out into the darkness, had so
puzzled the boys before. Here Murky, becoming
aware that someone was beyond him, had
crept up between rocks, listening when the boys
arrived, and had sprung upon them as has been
described.</p>

<p>For half a minute Nels stood, glaring at the
embers of the fire and around to see what else
might be there. But there was nothing, apparently,
beyond a few scraps of eatables and a
remnant of wet tow sacking.</p>

<p>"Coom on!" shouted the big Swede. "We
bane get nothin' here!" And he darted off in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
the darkness towards where Murky's retreating
steps had last been heard. But nothing resulted
except a trio of tired searchers with deep
mud on their legs and a sense that Murky had
eluded them again.</p>

<p>"I don't see any signs of money round here,"
gloomily owned Paul, looking about the rocky
recess where Murky had been quartered but a
short while before. "It is dark as pitch everywhere
else. One thing, Chip. I fancy we got
his grub, whatever he had left after eating."</p>

<p>"That's something," owned up Chip. "A
feller can't git along much in these woods unless
he has something to fill his belly with."</p>

<p>Anderson, paying little heed to this, was
staring into the fire, doubtless thinking matters
over. Chip picked up the tow-bagging,
scanned it closely and turned to Paul standing
near. He pointed at a shred of the bagging
that, without being detached from the sack, had
somehow caught a small patch of greenish
paper inside its loose clutch. Carefully Chip
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
picked out this, and handed it to Nels and
Paul.</p>

<p>"That looks like a piece of money," quoth
Chip. "Ain't it the corner of a bill of some
kind?"</p>

<p>Closer inspection revealed, even to Anderson's
thicker brain, that the paper shred had
undoubtedly been part of a bank note of some
kind. Being wet, it was easily torn from the
parent bank note in the rough handling the
money had undergone. At least such was the
conclusion drawn by all three after a short inspection.
Paul was greatly excited.</p>

<p>"What did I say when Phil found that old
suit-case? Murky must 'a' put the money in
something else. It must 'a' been all wet. He
must 'a' had that money here. What did he
do with it?"</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to hunt for it right now!" said
Chip now all eagerness.</p>

<p>"First we find Murky," interposed Nels.
"Vere he be, dere ve find money."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>"But Murky didn't have no load on him when
he tackled us!" was Chip's objection.</p>

<p>"I goin' make light," said Nels. "You look
roun'. Mebbe fin' money. Mebbe fin' nothin'.
I bane go fin' Murky. Make heem tell. Yah!"</p>

<p>And Anderson, who still had some use of his
big hands, picked up a hatchet left by the fugitive
in his haste and clumsily began to split
some dry pine which had long lain under shelter,
doubtless left there by former campers or
hunters. For several minutes the boys ferreted
their way into or through the neighboring
crevices among the jumble of rocks, even using
part of Anderson's splinters to aid them; but
nothing did they find.</p>

<p>"Now we go," said Nels at last. "You boys
bane tired mooch?"</p>

<p>The truth was all were pretty tired, but not
one would acknowledge the fact. Nels, used to
long fatigues, and crippled besides, made both
Paul and Chip reluctant to own up that they
needed sleep more than further travel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>The upshot of all this was that, in a short
time, all were following the mud trail left by
Murky in his flight but a brief spell back. The
fire had been replenished, so as to give them
some clue as to where they were, should they
wish to return. Chip bore the torch; Paul carried
an armload of fat splinters; while Nels,
plodding between, bent his woods-sharpened
eyes on the tracks that were plain enough yet,
for the rain had at last ceased.</p>

<p>After leading them a sinuous path through
the blackened wilderness for perhaps a mile,
the tracks turned sharply to the right and upward
along a more gravelly slant until what
seemed the backbone of a wooded ridge was attained.
Here the fire in consuming leaves,
fallen branches and most of the thinner undergrowth,
had thus swept from the gravel beneath
all the surface refuse. Probably this was
accomplished before the rains began.</p>

<p>In consequence the tracks, growing more and
more imperceptible, finally vanished entirely.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>"I bane tired," and Nels sat down, shaking
his great head discouragingly.</p>

<p>"Gee whiz!" gurgled Jones. "I almost wish
I was back in Staretta in my little bed 'stead of
way out here where I don't even know where I
am or how I'll get out again."</p>

<p>But Chip was made of sterner stuff. Seeing
his companions were in the dumps, he perked up
and sniffed the night air expectantly.</p>

<p>"What's the use of gittin' discouraged?
Mornin' 'll soon be here. We kin see that fire
yet, can't we? Les' go back and git some
sleep."</p>

<p>"No use of dat." This from Nels. "It bane
very late now. We git fire here. Sleep a bit."</p>

<p>But it was concluded not to make a fire, as it
might give the man they were hunting a clue
as to where they were. So the three prepared
to pass a comfortless night. Fortunately it
did not rain any more and, after a fashion, they
managed to endure the rest of the night. At
last, cool and cheerless, the dawn came, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
with the first glimmer the three set out along
the ridge. Nels kept to the summit, while the
boys patrolled the sides, keeping an eye out
amid the softer mud and ashes for any sign of
foot tracks.</p>

<p>A mile or more might have been traversed
thus when, at a shout from Chip, the others hastened
to him and saw that the boy had detected
distinct foot tracks leading away towards the
east.</p>

<p>"Fresh ones too," said Paul, pointing.
"And&#8211;look there. Criminy! I'm going to
take a look inside that hollow log."</p>

<p>He darted towards a rusty looking tree trunk
over which the fire had swept, leaving naught
but the solid wood cylinder of dead beech.
Most of the shrivelled bark, moss and dead
leaves were reduced to ashes. These the rain
had made into a moist, blackish gray mush.
At the larger end were plain signs as if some
heavy body had crawled inside and perhaps out
again. Nels, more up to woods lore, looked,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
sniffed, fingered clumsily, then delivered himself.</p>

<p>"Murkee, he bane sleep here yoost li'l whiles.
Git oop soon. He bane gone a'retty&#8211;yuss!"</p>

<p>"Gone&#8211;yes!" exclaimed Paul. "But where
did he go? How did he get away so all-fired
soon&#8211;hey?"</p>

<p>Here another call from Chip solved the question.
Not far below the hollow log began a
tiny slough which presently widened out until
footprints were discernible in the mushy tussocks
of what had before been a fringe of marsh-grass.
It was Chip who led the way now, and
eagerly pointed out further developments in
the hunt.</p>

<p>"Do you reckon this really is Murky we are
following?" asked Paul while Nels, tired,
hungry and sleepy as well, dragged along
dumbly.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" exclaimed Chip, who was bent on
solving the apparently unsolvable. "Who else
would it be way out here in this wilderness?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Murky:
Murky wouldn't be here if his own work hadn't
driven him into it. Let's go on."</p>

<p>And on they went, the trail growing plainer
as the slough widened and deepened. Finally
they came to a fallen tree extending from one
side of the slough to the other. The scorched,
blackened, rain-soaked top reached to their side.
Half way across the branches ceased and nothing
but a slimy black trunk reached to the other
side. Already they were about to pass this
when Chip, who was in the lead, suddenly
stopped.</p>

<p>"I don't see no more tracks," said he, seemingly
nonplussed.</p>

<p>At once Nels came forward, took one look
about, then pointed at a sooty limb projecting
landward from the trunk.</p>

<p>"W'at de matter wid dat?" he exclaimed.
"She bane go dat way."</p>

<p>"Sure&#8211;you're right!" cried Paul, instantly
comprehending. "But how will you get across,
Mr. Anderson?"</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>MURKY AT BAY</span></h2>

<p>Chip Slider, always willing when there was
something to do, caught hold of the limb that
showed signs of recent use and swung himself
up into the top. Paul Jones followed, but Anderson
shook his head as he tried to raise his
half useless arms. Without assistance he could
not make it. Yet it was evident that the fugitive
Murky must have taken that road.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Chip, landing on the other side
after a slippery passage on the log, saw the
tracks leading straight off through the woods
as if Murky well knew what he wanted and
where he was going. Paul, in crossing, noticed
midway of the log certain muddy smears
as if someone had either fallen off or had
climbed up on the log about midway of the
slough. This did not much impress him at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
time. Hastening on to join Chip, the two then
perceived that Nels was still on the other side.</p>

<p>"By cripes! Anderson can't make it, Chip!
We ought to have waited and helped him over.
That log's mighty slippery. Looks as if someone
had fallen off already. What had we better
do?"</p>

<p>"Say, Paul, this trail leads right back in the
direction of them rocks where we spent last
night. What do ye think of that?"</p>

<p>But Paul was now calling to Nels on the other
side. He had heard what Chip said and shouted
to the big Swede its import. At this Nels
solved the difficulty in a few words, directing
the boys&#8211;if they were sure of this&#8211;to follow
the new trail while Nels would go back to the
head of the slough and rejoin them somewhere
near the foot of the rocky ridge they had previously
traversed.</p>

<p>Still the trail was puzzling. Both lads found
not only a fresh trail leading ridgeward, but
signs of an earlier trail, now much rainwashed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
that led towards the slough, not away from it
as the fresh trail did.</p>

<p>"Tell you what I believe, Paul," remarked
Chip after studying the situation over. "When
Murky first struck out he was trying to get
clear off, probably east somewhere. He must
'a' come this way, tried to cross the run here
and couldn't. He might 'a' fell off that log
where you saw them stains.</p>

<p>"What would he do then? Why, strike for
higher ground; git to some place where he could
make a fire. That took him back to where he
run against us. And if it hadn't 'a' been for
Nels, I ain't sure but what he'd a got the best
in that mix-up. What do you think?"</p>

<p>What Chip thought was indicated by his
pointing finger, for he was ahead, following the
trail, now growing more and more indistinct.
Paul came up and looked at the faint outline of
tracks now turning abruptly up the rocky
ridge.</p>

<p>"Murky&#8211;if 'twas Murky&#8211;is goin' right back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
where he and us spent last night. Now what
would he be doin' that for? There hain't but
one reason that counts," affirmed Chip. "He's
hid out that money somewhere&#8211;don't you
reckon?"</p>

<p>All at once the significance of this appealed
to both the boys. As with one accord they eagerly
resumed their trail hunt, but it was with
such scant success that Paul finally shook his
head in discouragement. Chip, now on hands
and knees, stooping, at times almost crawling,
was inclined to give up too.</p>

<p>"You remember how we lost that trail before
on this ridge and only found it when we
separated, taking in the lowland on either
side?"</p>

<p>"Yep! That's what we'll have to do now.
Wish Nels was here. Wonder where he is
now?" And Paul peered in the direction of
the slough.</p>

<p>With one accord both lads waited a few minutes,
but seeing no sign of the vanished Swede,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
it was agreed that Chip should take one side of
the ridge and Paul the other, and at each mile
of progress or thereabouts, should let each other
know. If, meanwhile, one should strike the
trail again he should call or go in search of the
other.</p>

<p>Possibly Paul had gone a mile, when a rumbling,
heavy voice halted him. No trail had he
found, but&#8211;there was Anderson coming, having
at last rounded the head of the slough.</p>

<p>"You find him yet?" meaning the vanished
trail. "He bane go dis way?"</p>

<p>"No, we lost it on the ridge like we did before.
Chip is looking for it on the other side
of this slope. I hope he has better luck than
us."</p>

<p>"Let's res' a leetle, Paul," and Nels slumped
heavily down.</p>

<p>At this juncture came a faint call from the
other side of the ridge. Paul jumped up again,
saying:</p>

<p>"Come on, Mr. Anderson! That must be
Chip. He's found something, for we agreed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
to let each other know, whichever came on anything
first."</p>

<p>And Paul gave an answering shout, starting
up the gentle rise of the rocky elevation, on top
of which both trails had vanished.</p>

<p>"Alright&#8211;I bane coomin'," responded Nels
as he wearily got up and tried to keep up with
Paul's hasty steps, but soon gave that up. "I
bane tired&#8211;all een&#8211;das w'at."</p>

<p>Young Slider had felt all along the keenest interest
in the recovery of that stolen money.
His dead father's participation therein probably
kept him stimulated by a desire to show
his new-found friends, the Auto Boys that he
was worthy to be trusted.</p>

<p>After some futile search he was at length
gratified to discover signs of the vanished trail.
It came down from the higher ground where the
rocks and gravel made it indistinguishable.
Filled with new courage he followed on, pleased
that it became more plain as the lower ground
grew softer and more mushy. At this juncture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
he began calling to Paul, and perhaps it was indiscreet
in view of what presently happened.</p>

<p>But Chip was not thinking of himself. Instead,
as he gave his last shout and heard the
faint echo of Paul's reply, he only thought that
he was again on the track of Murky. Where
was Murky now?</p>

<p>"I hope we'll soon know," he said to himself
as he plodded on, on&#8211;eyes on the ground and
seeing little of things around him. "I hope
Paul hurries. He'd help a lot&#8211;"</p>

<p>"Blame <i>me!</i>" A savage growl struck on
Chip's ears. "It's that durned little Slider
cuss."</p>

<p>With a curdling chill Chip raised his eyes
and was astounded by what he saw. Having
gone farther than he thought, amid his eagerness
to get on and his constant scrutiny of the
trail, he saw around him the same rocks rising
to his right that they had approached the night
before. And right under the heavy ledge where
he and Paul had been sheltered, prior to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
Murky's attack, stood Murky himself, mud-slimed,
gaunt, fierce, and scowlingly savage.</p>

<p>"Ain't I never goin' to git rid of you?" he
snapped, drawing menacingly near. "You'll
not dodge me this time!"</p>

<p>With this Murky lurched forward, his claw-like
hand reaching forth. Chip let out a yell of
terror. He could not help it. The yell would
come, and it rang far-reaching, striking on
Anderson's ear as the Swede, having recovered,
was crossing the ridge's backbone not so very
far away. That yell smote upon Paul not unlike
the effect of an unexpected thunder clap.
But Paul recognized the voice. Chip was in
trouble. He&#8211;Paul&#8211;was not with him. Gripping
his courage, he rushed on, rounding a
bulge of rock just in time to see Chip being
dragged within that same recess whence both
Murky and Nels had emerged the night before,
one to attack, the other to rescue the two boys.</p>

<p>"Look here!" cried Paul, now more angry
than ever, his fear of Murky quite gone for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
time being. "You let that boy alone! Hear
me?"</p>

<p>Apparently the tramp did not, for he disappeared
through the elbowed recess still dragging
the struggling Chip. Just then Paul
stumbled and was nearly thrown down by hitting
a smooth, round rock with his foot. Recovering,
he picked up that rock and darted through
the recess after Murky with his captive. His
other hand also found that pistol with which he
had clipped the robber's ear, and which Paul
had hung onto, thinking he might have a use for
it. No cartridges were in it of course, but still
it was a weapon.</p>

<p>In one corner of that recess where the fire
had been built Murky had young Slider down
and apparently was choking the life out of the
lad. Without a word Paul ran up, heaved the
rock and, as luck would have it, struck the robber
fairly right over the head.</p>

<p>A less hard-headed man would have toppled
over. But Murky was hard-headed as well as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
hard-hearted. He reeled upon his knees and
his clutch upon Chip relaxed sufficiently to enable
that thoroughly frightened youngster to
wriggle away on hands and knees while Murky
was recovering.</p>

<p>The latter scrambled to his feet, his head
smarting. Roaring, he lunged at Paul, who
darted back, his only real weapon gone and
wondering what to do next. More by instinct
than anything he levelled the empty pistol at
the robber, shouting at the same time:</p>

<p>"Keep off&#8211;keep off! I&#8211;I'll shoot&#8211;"</p>

<p>But by this time Murky had recovered his
poise and his strength as well. For all he knew
Paul might send bullets his way, but that did
not now stop the ruffian. With a savage snort
of anger he sprang upon the boy, wrenched
from him the pistol and straightway began to
beat Paul over the head. About this time
Murky felt a clinging form jump upon his back,
wind its thin arms and legs around his half
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
reeling frame, as Paul struck at him with boyish
impetuosity, though the blows were futile
so far as doing the man any serious harm.</p>

<p>"Blame ye both!" he exploded. "I'll fix ye&#8211;blast
ye!"</p>

<p>And fix them both he methodically proceeded
to do. Seizing Paul by the scruff of his neck
and twisting Chip somehow under his other arm,
he then tried to bang their heads together.
Luckily he did not succeed before there was a
sudden interruption.</p>

<p>For the second time there came in Murky's
rear a rumbling roar of anger. Nels Anderson,
just arrived, breathless, exhausted, was yet
ready to do what might be done by a tired man
almost without the use of his arms.</p>

<p>At the sound close behind him Murky turned,
his savage claws fastened in the half helpless
boys' clothing. Pushing them before him, he
rushed upon the Swede. The impact was too
much for Nels.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>Back he staggered, his heels tripping, and
fell with the two youngsters on top of his prostrate
bulk.</p>

<p>By the time the three got to their feet again
Murky had vanished. But they heard him farther
on, and in an instant Chip was off, crying:</p>

<p>"We mustn't lose him! He's back after that
money! I just know it!"</p>

<p>Was Chip right? Only quick work might
solve that riddle. In a trice Paul was at Chip's
heels while Nels, puffing more than ever, yet
still game, came on after. Arrived at the next
turning, they saw Murky dragging at something
in a dark corner or crevice of rock. Seeing
his pursuers coming, Murky rushed blindly
at them. Chip managed to dodge but Paul was
overborne and, stumbling back, brought up
against Nels, and again a rough-and-tumble
struggle began. Meantime Chip, having
dodged, saw what Murky, down on his knees,
had been dragging at when again surprised.
Intuition told him what it might be. Instead of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
going to the aid of his companions Chip stooped
over, dragged out a wet, soiled package from a
deeper crevice, ran off through another passage
that seemed to wind among a number of
converging boulders, and&#8211;a moment later returned
empty-handed to where the fight was
still going on.</p>

<p>Murky now had the big Swede down and was
pummelling him over head and face with his
fists. Anderson was rolling, twisting about,
striving ineffectually to wriggle loose. From
behind Paul Jones was doing his best to drag
the robber back. Paul had him by the hair
and collar. When Chip came back, he had managed
to hit Paul with one right-handed fist and
the boy was gasping.</p>

<p>All this went through Chip like a flash of
lightning out of a clear sky. Seizing a good
sized fragment of rock, he began pounding
Murky about the head.</p>

<p>"Blame ye!" roared the thief. "Will ye
quit? I&#8211;I'll&#8211;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>Further utterance was checked by Murky's
turning and flinging himself full length upon
young Slider. Bearing him to the ground, the
lad was soon knocked into unconsciousness by
Murky's powerful blows.</p>

<p>"Git outer my way!" he shouted, rising and
making a break for the same place where Chip
had seen him stooping not ten minutes before.
"Blame me! I&#8211;I'll&#8211;where is it? What have
ye done with it? Ye will, will ye?"</p>

<p>By this time, blinded by baffled rage, Murky
proceeded&#8211;as Chip afterwards expressed it&#8211;"to
wipe up the earth" with his opponents.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>CONCLUSION</span></h2>

<p>Through the nearer passages under the leaning
rocks, approaching footsteps were heard,
hurried steps, that even Murky had to heed.
Then came Link Fraley, followed by Phil, Dave,
Billy&#8211;the Auto Boys. Behind those was Mr.
Beckley, breathing heavily as if tired by undue
haste.</p>

<p>No sooner had Murky seen who they were
than he sprang up from the scramble wherein
he, the Swede and Paul were engaged, and made
a break for another passage. But Link, who
happened to be nearest, thrust out one long
leg. With another cry of rage Murky went
prostrate.</p>

<p>For a few minutes&#8211;or was it seconds?&#8211;a
struggle went on. But Murky's day of probation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
was at last over. Actually weeping with
anger, Anderson strove to reach his late opponent.
Paul, though somewhat bruised from
his own struggles, also tried to do his bit in
securing the scowling man. But it was not
necessary. In another short space of time
Murky lay there helpless. His arms were
bound behind his back, his legs and feet also
secured.</p>

<p>One of the first things Mr. Beckley did was
to walk up to Anderson and shake his nerveless
hand with great vigor. Then he did the same
thing to Paul, who was also being congratulated
by the other boys. Then Beckley turned to
Anderson, saying:</p>

<p>"It was brave and faithful of you, Nels, to
start out all by yourself. But it was you and
this&#8211;this lad who really rounded up the rascal."</p>

<p>"You forget Chip Slider, Mr. Beckley, don't
you?" Paul Jones liked to be fair, though at
times he was too forward. "Chip was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
along&#8211;why, where is Chip? I'd forgot him for the
moment."</p>

<p>Link Fraley and Phil Way were bending over
Chip's still prostrate form where he lay after
being so maltreated by the scowling villain
who now lay bound not more than ten feet
away.</p>

<p>Attention thus drawn, the entire party devoted
themselves to the task of reviving young
Slider, who it appeared was only stunned and
bruised by his treatment at the hands of the
robber.</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Beckley again took the lead in
questioning. "Of course I&#8211;we feel deeply
grateful. The Longknives will do almost anything
for those who were most active in securing
this fellow and his ill-gotten booty. He'll have
to face a murder charge too, as there is little
doubt but that he dragged Grandall to his death
inside that burning building. And now that we
have the thief and the money&#8211;"</p>

<p>"Are you sure we've got the money, sir?"
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
It was MacLester who asked this for, Scotch-like,
Dave was always ready to cast doubt upon
most anything that was not proved before all
men. "I don't see any money!"</p>

<p>"Of course we may not see it right now, yet
I don't doubt but that you and Murky know
where it is?" This to Nels and Paul, who both
looked rather nonplussed. "Where is it,
Nels?"</p>

<p>"I&#8211;I&#8211;" Anderson was stammering and
confused in manner. "I bane not sure I can
tell. That feller, he know." He pointed at
Murky who glared evilly at the crowd in general.</p>

<p>"Ye needn't look for me to tell anything,"
he snarled. "I got no money!"</p>

<p>"If you had, you'd lie about it," was Beckley's
comment that seemed to meet the general
opinion among his captors.</p>

<p>Murky relapsing into sullen silence, Beckley
resumed his queries.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that having gotten this scoundrel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
here," indicating Murky, "you don't know
where his plunder is?"</p>

<p>"Wish I did, sir," said Paul Jones, turning
from Chip who was just beginning to be conscious
of outward things.</p>

<p>"And you, too, do not know where the money
is?" Beckley turned again to Anderson, who
squirmed rather uneasily.</p>

<p>"Wush I did," the latter muttered. "I bane
coom after the boys. Ven I coom oop wid 'em,
dey vass in mix-oop wid heem," pointing at
Murky.</p>

<p>"That fellow must 'a' had the money hid
out somewhere," said Paul. "We followed him
for miles. Finally we lost the trail, then we
came on him by accident, as it were. He was
about to get the best of Chip and me when in
came Nels, here, and Murky disappeared. It
was in the night. In the morning we struck his
trail again. But he never seemed to have the
money with him. It is all a mystery to me.
Isn't that the way of it, Nels?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>Nels gave a sheepish nod of assent.</p>

<p>"Well, it's something big to have apprehended
this fellow. Before we are through with
him I dare say we will know where that stolen
money is."</p>

<p>Mr. Beckley spoke with grim purpose which,
however, did not belie his apparent disappointment
that the stolen twenty thousand dollars
was not forthcoming, or at least some knowledge
gained as to its present whereabouts.</p>

<p>Here Chip Slider, reclining against Link
Fraley, who was still solicitously supporting
the boy's dizzy head, blinked and strove to raise
himself. Clearing his throat, he asked in a
shaky voice:</p>

<p>"Is it the money they want to know about?"
This, apparently, to Link.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, boy! We've got hands on the
thief," meaning Murky. "But what Mr. Beckley
wants to know now, is what's become of the
swag, the boodle, the stuff Murky stole. He
won't tell, and you chaps don't seem to know."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>"Yes, we do!" replied Chip unexpectedly.
Then he sat up unaided.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, my lad?" queried Beckley,
a quizzical smile on his face for he had
not fully determined the reason of Chip's being
here except in a casually superfluous way.</p>

<p>"I mean that&#8211;" glancing at Paul and Nels,
"&#8211;that we know where the money is. At least
it looks like the money and Murky seemed
mighty anxious to get his paws on it."</p>

<p>Giving little heed to the wonder in the faces
of the Swede and Jones, the boy tried to get to
his feet. "Help me up, please. I'll be all right
in a minute. There! Now if you will all go
with me, I'll show you what I mean."</p>

<p>Still supported by Fraley, though Chip was
almost himself again, he led the party to a deep
crevice where some dirt had been hastily pawed
out.</p>

<p>"Right here I saw Murky on his knees trying
to pull out something from this hole. About
that time he saw us again, and the way he went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
for us kep' him busy with Nels and Paul. It
flashed through me what Murky was after. I
left them fightin'. It was two to one, anyhow.
When I got to this hole I pulled out a wet bundle
that I took to be the money. Seemed like I
could see the bills or the corners of them in
bundles."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" exclaimed Beckley eagerly.
"They would be apt to be in packages. You
were right; I feel sure you were right!"</p>

<p>"But where are those bills now? Where is
the bundle?" asked Link.</p>

<p>Without a word Chip, unaided, led the group
to the nearby recess where he had hurriedly
stowed them. Pointing, he continued:</p>

<p>"That there is what I drug out of yonder
hole, sir. I guess it's the money, or Murky
wouldn't 'a' been so anxious about gittin' it."</p>

<p>It was the missing money, of course. Practically
intact, too, although it was wet and in
places mud-soaked. The bags of coin were
there. One had a small rip in the seam, doubtless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
where the coin had escaped that Paul found
near the dilapidated suit-case.</p>

<p>Here Paul's enthusiasm at last broke loose.</p>

<p>"Oh, you Chip!" he cried. "You're the
goods, ain't you? That then was the reason
you didn't stop and help us fight Murky!"</p>

<p>"Yah&#8211;he had good reesons&#8211;heh!" This
from Nels, now rejoicing like the rest. "I bane
like you, Cheep; zat I does!"</p>

<p>After that nothing apparently was too good
for young Slider. Even Mr. Beckley, dropping
his previous air of good-humored toleration,
declared that Chip deserved real commendation.</p>

<p>"You have showed pluck and perseverance,
for you were about to start after that skunk
Murky alone when our young friend Paul Jones
joined you. And Nels, our good old Nels,
crippled though he was, came swiftly on the
trail of you both, arriving just when help was
needed."</p>

<p>"Yes, Paul," remarked Phil, "our crowd
came just in time too; but if it had not been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
for you three, I guess we would not have both
prisoner and money in our hands right now."</p>

<p>"That reminds me," interrupted Link, starting
off on a run. "Who stayed behind to watch
that devil Murky?"</p>

<p>As with one accord the others, except Mr.
Beckley and Chip Slider, started after Fraley,
leaving those two to bring along the money. A
moment later they broke into the passage where
Murky had been left, and found that the wily
rascal had already loosed his hands by rubbing
the cords that bound his wrists against a sharp
edge of the rocks, and was at work upon the
bindings that held his feet. These were only
partially freed. Seeing his captors approach,
he jumped up, made a reckless bolt for freedom,
but fell sprawling on the earth. In a trice the
others were upon him and after a brief struggle
had him tied hard and fast again.</p>

<p>"You'll not get away again, old chap," was
Billy's comment as he tied the last knot.
"There's a thing called law and justice you've
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
got to face before you're done with this crowd!"</p>

<p>While Mr. Beckley, with Anderson's aid, and
with sundry others looking on, carefully counted
over the wet, draggled, yet still good contents of
the package thus found, there came a rattle of
wheels. Presently two teamsters from Staretta
appeared, with word that they had managed to
bring their teams thus far, but the mud and
thickening tree trunks might prevent their going
farther.</p>

<p>"Guess you won't have to go farther, my
men," spoke up Mr. Beckley. "Can we get
back to Staretta by night&#8211;with a prisoner, and
also three more of our friends who came on before?"</p>

<p>"Sure we can! We've broke such road as
there is in comin'." The speaker, a red-faced,
burly looking man, was shaking hands with Nels,
for he was one of the old gravel road workers
whom the Longknives had never paid as yet.</p>

<p>"Well then," remarked Beckley to whom all
deferred as the leader in their subsequent proceedings,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
"we will get a move on at once. I
am anxious to reach town where I can telephone.
It is lucky that I changed my mind and did not
go on by rail, when I found that these boys were
already after the prisoner yonder," indicating
Murky, "and that the other Auto Boys, with
Mr. Fraley, were going at once in pursuit. I
may state here that, though the clubhouse is
gone and Grandall along with it, we have recovered
the twenty thousand dollars. If I know
the Longknives Club, they will now be more than
willing to pay all claims against them by those
who trusted them. It was long delayed, yet
it could not be helped. I trust to put all things
straight before I leave your hospitable little
town."</p>

<p>Needless to state good, clean Staretta beds
were occupied by the Andersons, the Auto Boys,
the golfing man, his servant Daddy O'Lear, and
Chip Slider that night. Even Murky, though
guarded in the village lock-up, had a more comfortable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
place to sleep than he had enjoyed
for some time. Later, under a warrant duly
drawn, charging him with murder and robbery,
he was conveyed to the jail at the county seat
to await the grand jury and the court.</p>

<p>Before Mr. Beckley left, and after he had
wired particulars of these recent events to the
Longknives Club, he received by wire the hearty
acquiescence from them in the plan already
formulated for the disposition of the stolen and
rescued twenty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>First, there was to be medical aid for Nels
Anderson, and a restoration of the money losses
he had sustained in the building of that
gravelled road. Also Chip Slider was to be
helped and aided for the plucky way he had
acted, especially in removing the money from
where Murky, had he come back in a hurry,
would have found it. Next those workmen who
had been employed three years before must receive
the money due them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>Lastly a new automobile should be provided
without undue delay for the Auto Boys. It
certainly was due them. Had it not been for
their bravery and devotion to duty the tragedy
making up the last chapter of the gravel
road's history would have been far, far more
terrible.</p>

<p>It was not long until all Mr. Beckley's plans
were carried out. Legally the Longknives Club
had never been disbanded and the funds were
unanimously voted as he proposed.</p>

<p>But how about poor Chip Slider?</p>

<p>There is today no more contented boy in
Lannington, the home city of the Auto Boys,
than he.</p>

<p>Without loss of time the chums returned
home, taking Chip with them. He's working
for Con Cecil in a newspaper office there and
going to night school. All his questioning if
peace and plenty might not be found somewhere,
sometime, has been most pleasingly answered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>There was gladness and thanksgiving in the
homes of all the boys' families when the telegrams
telling of their escape from the great
forest fire were received. A most happy homecoming
it was for all, a day or so later.</p>

<p>Scarcely a week had passed when Henry
Beckley and a committee of Longknives drove
up to the green and yellow garage the Auto
Boys called their own, and there delivered a
truly splendid new car.</p>

<p>On part of the boys' families and their friends
there was much ado about it all. A dinner by
the Lannington Automobile Club, and a great
many more fine speeches than the four chums
relished hearing about themselves, was one such
thing.</p>

<p>"And I will venture to say," spoke Mr. Beckley,
in the course of his after dinner address, on
this occasion, "that whatever the future has in
store for our friends, they will be found active
and alert in time of play, in time of work or in
time of danger."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>"The Auto Boys' Big Six," a book wherein
the later experiences of the chums will be
reported, should in due time enable you to
judge whether Mr. Beckley was correct.</p>

<p class='c mt20'>THE END</p>
